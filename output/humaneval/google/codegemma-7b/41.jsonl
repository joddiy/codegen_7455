The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n):\n    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0\n    collisions = 0\n\n    # Initialize the positions of the cars\n    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]\n    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Initialize the velocities of the cars\n    left_velocities = [1 for i in range(n)]\n    right_velocities = [-1 for i in range(n)]\n\n    # While there are still cars on the road\n    while len(left_cars) > 0 and len(right_cars) > 0:\n        # Find the next collision\n        collision_index = -1\n        for i in range(len(left_cars)):\n            for j in range(len(right_cars)):\n                if left_cars[i] + left_velocities[i] == right_cars[j] + right_velocities[j]:\n                    collision_index = i\n                    break\n            if collision_index != -1:\n                break\n\n        # If there is a collision\n        if collision_index != -1:\n            # Increment the number of collisions\n            collisions += 1\n\n            # Remove the car that collided from the left cars list\n            left_cars.pop(collision_index)\n\n            # Remove the car that collided from the right cars list\n            right_cars.pop(j)\n\n    # Return the number of collisions\n    return collisions\n```\n"}
