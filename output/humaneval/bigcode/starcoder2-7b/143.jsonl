It then creates an empty list to store the prime words.\n\nThe function then loops through each word in the list of words and checks if the length of the word is prime using the `is_prime` function. If the word is prime, it is added to the list of prime words.\n\nFinally, the function joins the list of prime words into a single string using the `join()` method and returns the string.\n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by looping through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is prime.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis problem was a good example of how to use Python to solve a problem. The solution was simple and easy to understand.\n\n---\n\n## Problem 2\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.
