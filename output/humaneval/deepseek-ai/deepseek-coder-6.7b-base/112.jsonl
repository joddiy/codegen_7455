It first converts the strings into lists using the list() function. Then, it iterates over each character in the string c and removes all occurrences of that character from the list s using the remove() method. Finally, it joins the remaining characters in the list s back into a string using the join() method and returns a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean value indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome or not.\n\n### Test Cases:\n\n```python\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\")) # ('bcd', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdef\", \"b\")) # ('acdef', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdedcba\", \"ab\")) # ('cdedc', True)\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reverse_delete() function takes two strings as input and returns a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean value indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome or not. The function works by first converting the strings into lists and then iterating over each character in the string c and removing all occurrences of that character from the list s.
