For each element, it checks if it is already in the `unique_numbers` list. If it is not, it is added to the list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `unique_numbers` list, which contains only the unique elements from the input list.\n\n### Testing:\n\nTo test the function, we can use the `doctest` module in Python. The `doctest` module allows us to write tests in the docstring of a function, and then run the tests to verify that the function works as expected.\n\nHere is an example of how we can use the `doctest` module to test the `remove_duplicates` function:\n\n```python\nimport doctest\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_numbers = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number not in unique_numbers:\n            unique_numbers.append(number)\n    return unique_numbers\n\ndoctest.testmod()\n```\n\nIn this example, we have added a docstring to the `remove_duplicates` function that includes a test case for the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`. We then use the `doctest.testmod()` function to run the tests and verify that the function works as expected.\n\nIf all the tests pass, the function is working as expected. If any of the tests fail, the function will need to be updated to fix the bug.\n\n### Refactoring:\n\nTo improve the code, we can refactor it to make it more concise and easier to read. Here is an example of how we can refactor the code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(numbers))\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `set` data structure in Python to remove duplicates from the input list. The `set` data structure only keeps unique elements, so we can use it to remove duplicates from the input list.\n\nFinally, we convert the `set` back to a `list` using the `list` function, and return the result.\n\n### Testing and Refactoring:\n\nTo test the refactored code, we can use the same `doct", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_numbers = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number not in unique_numbers:\n            unique_numbers.append(number)\n    return unique_numbers\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list.\n\nThe function uses a loop to iterate over each element in the input list.
