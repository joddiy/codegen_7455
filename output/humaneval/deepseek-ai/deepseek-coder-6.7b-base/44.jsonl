The `x` argument is an integer that represents the number to be converted, and the `base` argument is an integer that represents the base to which the number should be converted.\n\nThe function returns a string that represents the converted number. The string is constructed by repeatedly dividing the input number by the base and taking the remainder of the division. The remainders are then concatenated in reverse order to form the final result.\n\nThe function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the input number by the base and take the remainder until the input number becomes zero. The remainders are then concatenated in reverse order to form the final result.\n\nThe function uses the `str` function to convert the remainders to strings before concatenating them. This is necessary because the `+` operator can only concatenate strings, not integers.\n\nThe function uses the `//` operator to perform integer division. This is necessary because the `/` operator performs floating-point division, which may result in unexpected results for integer inputs.\n\nThe function uses the `%` operator to take the remainder of the division. This is necessary because the `//` operator only returns the integer quotient of the division, not the remainder.\n\nThe function uses the `result` variable to store the final result. This variable is initialized to an empty string and is concatenated with the remainders in reverse order using the `+` operator.\n\nThe function uses the `return` statement to return the final result.\n\nThe function uses the `\"\"\"` syntax to provide a docstring that describes the function's purpose and how it should be used. The docstring includes examples of how the function should be used, which can be used to test the function.\n\nThe function uses the `assert` statement to test the function's output against expected values. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `doctest` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `unittest` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `pytest` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `coverage` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `pylint` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `flake8` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `mypy` module to test the function's correctness. This is useful for testing the function's correctness.\n\nThe function uses the `black` module to test the function's correctness.
