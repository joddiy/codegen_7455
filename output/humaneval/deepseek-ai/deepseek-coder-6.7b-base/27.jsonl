I was able to complete the problem in a few minutes. I used a for loop to iterate through the string and check if the character is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, I add the lowercase version of the character to the new string. If it is lowercase, I add the uppercase version of the character to the new string. If it is neither, I add the character to the new string. I then return the new string.\n\n### Feedback:\nI think this problem was a good one.
