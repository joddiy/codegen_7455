The function first splits the sentence into words using the `split()` method, and then iterates over the words using a loop. For each word, the function checks if its length is a prime number using the `is_prime()` helper function. If the length is prime, the word is added to a list of prime words. Finally, the function joins the prime words into a single string and returns it.\n\nThe `is_prime()` helper function checks if a number is prime by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if it is divisible by any of them. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input string contains only letters and spaces, and that the order of the words in the original sentence should be preserved in the output string. If the input string contains other characters or punctuation, the solution may need to be modified to handle these cases.\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
