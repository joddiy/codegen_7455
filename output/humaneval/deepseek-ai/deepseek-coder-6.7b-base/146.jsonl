It then iterates through the array `nums` and checks if each number is greater than 10 and both first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). If the number satisfies these conditions, the function increments `count` by 1. Finally, the function returns `count`.\n\nThe function is tested using the `test_specialFilter` function. The function asserts that `specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15])` returns 1 and `specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109])` returns 2.\n\nThe function is then called using `test_specialFilter()`. The function returns nothing, but the output shows that the function passed the tests.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). The function is tested using the `test_specialFilter` function and the function is called using `test_specialFilter()`. The function passed the tests and returned nothing, but the output shows that the function passed the tests.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
