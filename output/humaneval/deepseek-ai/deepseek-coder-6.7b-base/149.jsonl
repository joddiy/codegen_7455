The function first creates an empty list `sorted_list` to store the sorted list. Then, it iterates through the list `lst` and adds each word to the `sorted_list` if it is not already in the list and its length is even. The `sorted_list` is then sorted by length of each word using the `sort` method with a custom key function that returns the length of each word. Finally, the function returns the `sorted_list`.\n\nThe function is tested with the test cases provided in the instruction. The first test case asserts that the function returns `[\"aa\"]` when given the list `[\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]`, and the second test case asserts that the function returns `[\"ab\", \"cd\"]` when given the list `[\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `sorted_list_sum` is a Python function that takes a list of strings as a parameter and returns a list of strings. The function first creates an empty list `sorted_list` to store the sorted list, then iterates through the list `lst` and adds each word to the `sorted_list` if it is not already in the list and its length is even.
