The function uses the `len` function to get the length of the string. The function is annotated with a docstring that describes the function's purpose and how it should be used. The function is also tested using doctests.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis solution is a simple function that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string. The function is annotated with a docstring that describes the function's purpose and how it should be used. The function is also tested using doctests.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis solution is a simple function that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string.
