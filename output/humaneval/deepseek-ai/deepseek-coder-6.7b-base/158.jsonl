If multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters, the function returns the one that comes first in lexicographical order.\n\nThe function first initializes an empty string `max_word` and a variable `max_unique_chars` to 0. It then iterates through each word in the list using a for loop. For each word, it creates a set of unique characters using the `set` function and checks if the number of unique characters is greater than the current maximum number of unique characters. If so, it updates the `max_word` and `max_unique_chars` variables accordingly. If the number of unique characters is equal to the current maximum number of unique characters, the function checks if the current word comes before the current maximum word in lexicographical order. If so, it updates the `max_word` variable accordingly.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `max_word` variable, which contains the word with the maximum number of unique characters.\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nassert find_max([\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"]) == \"string\"\nassert find_max([\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"]) == \"enam\"\nassert find_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\" ,\"cc\"]) == \"aaaaaaa\"\n```\n\n### Time Complexity:\nThe time complexity of the `find_max` function is O(n), where n is the number of words in the input list. This is because the function iterates through each word in the list once, and for each word, it performs a constant-time operation (creating a set of unique characters).\n\n### Space Complexity:\nThe space complexity of the `find_max` function is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `max_word` and `max_unique_chars` variables.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, and it correctly returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
