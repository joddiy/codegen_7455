The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a coordinate of the integer `x` in the list `lst`. The function first creates an empty list `coordinates` to store the coordinates of the integer `x`. Then, it loops through the rows of the list `lst` using a for loop. For each row, it loops through the columns of the row using a for loop. If the element at the current position is equal to `x`, it adds the coordinate to the list `coordinates`. Finally, it sorts the coordinates by row in ascending order using the", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
