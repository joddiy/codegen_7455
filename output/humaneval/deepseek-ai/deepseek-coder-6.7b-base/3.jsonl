The function iterates over each integer in the list and adds it to a running total called `balance`. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function returns `True`. If the balance never falls below zero, the function returns `False`.\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can use the `doctest` module in Python. The `doctest` module allows us to write tests in the docstring of the function. We can write tests for different input values and expected output values.\n\n```python\nimport doctest\n\ndoctest.testmod()\n```\n\nThis will run the tests in the docstring and print the results. If all the tests pass, the function is working as expected.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis script solves the problem of detecting if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point. The function `below_zero` takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. The function iterates over each integer in the list and adds it to a running total called `balance`.
