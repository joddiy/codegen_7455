The function first initializes an empty string `result`. Then, it iterates over the indices of the input strings `a` and `b`. For each index `i`, it checks if the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`. If they are equal, it appends a \"0\" to the `result` string. Otherwise, it appends a \"1\" to the `result` string. Finally, it returns the `result` string.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the `doctest` module. The `doctest` module automatically tests the function by running the code examples in the docstring. The function is tested with the following inputs and expected outputs:\n```python\n>>> string_xor('010', '110')\n'100'\n>>> string_xor('101', '001')\n'100'\n>>> string_xor('111', '111')\n'000'\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `string_xor` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and returns a string as output. The function performs binary XOR on the input strings and returns the result as a string. The function is tested using the `doctest` module.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
