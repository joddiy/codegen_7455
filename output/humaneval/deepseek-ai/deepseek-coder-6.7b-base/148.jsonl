It returns a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by the proximity to the sun. The function returns an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names.\n\nThe function first defines a list of planets in our solar system. It then finds the index of planet1 and planet2 in the list. It then uses the index of planet1 and planet2 to find the planets between them. It returns the planets between them as a tuple.\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nbf(\"Jupiter\", \"Neptune\") ==> (\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\")\nbf(\"Earth\", \"Mercury\") ==> (\"Venus\")\nbf(\"Mercury\", \"Uranus\") ==> (\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\")\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThis solution works by finding the index of the two planets in the list of planets. It then uses the index to find the planets between them. It returns the planets between them as a tuple.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis solution works by finding the index of the two planets in the list of planets.
