If it doesn't, it returns `False`.\n\nIt then creates a set `seen` to store the elements that have been seen so far.\n\nThe function iterates over the elements in the list. For each element, it checks if the complement of the current element (i.e., the number that would sum to zero with the current element) is in the set `seen`. If it is, it means that there is a pair of distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so the function returns `True`.\n\nIf no pair of elements sum to zero is found, the function returns `False`.\n\n### Test Cases:\nThe function is tested with the following test cases:\n\n- `pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])`: This test case checks that the function returns `False` when there are no pairs of distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.\n- `pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])`: This test case checks that the function returns `False` when there are no pairs of distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.\n- `pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])`: This test case checks that the function returns `False` when there are no pairs of distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.\n- `pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])`: This test case checks that the function returns `True` when there are pairs of distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.\n- `pairs_sum_to_zero([1])`: This test case checks that the function returns `False` when there are no pairs", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
