The special factorial of `n` is defined as the product of the first `n` factorials, i.e., `n` factorial multiplied by `(n-1)` factorial, multiplied by `(n-2)` factorial, and so on, all the way down to `1` factorial.\n\nThe function uses a recursive approach to calculate the special factorial of `n`. If `n` is `0`, the function returns `1`, as the special factorial of `0` is defined as `1`. Otherwise, the function multiplies `n` by the special factorial of `n-1`, and returns the result.\n\nThe function is defined as a docstring, which provides a brief description of the function and its parameters. The docstring also includes an example of how the function can be used.\n\nThe function is defined as a docstring, which provides a brief description of the function and its parameters.
