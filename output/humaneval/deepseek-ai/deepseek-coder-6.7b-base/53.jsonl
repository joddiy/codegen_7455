The function uses the `return` keyword to return the result of the addition operation. The `>>>` symbols are used to indicate the expected output for the function.\n\nThe function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and the parameters in parentheses. The function body is indented and enclosed in triple quotes. The function's docstring is defined using the triple quotes, and it includes a brief description of the function and the expected output for each test case.\n\nThe function uses the `return` keyword to return the result of the addition operation. The `return` keyword is followed by the expression that represents the result of the addition operation.\n\nThe function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and the parameters in parentheses.
