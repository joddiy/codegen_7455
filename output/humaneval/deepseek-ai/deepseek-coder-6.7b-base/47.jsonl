The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort` method. Then it calculates the length of the list `n` and checks if it is even or odd. If it is even, it returns the average of the middle two elements. If it is odd, it returns the middle element.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the doctest module. The doctest module allows you to write tests in the docstring of a function. The tests are written in the docstring and are executed when the function is imported. The tests are written in a format called \"doctest\" and are executed by the doctest module. The doctest module will run the tests and check if the output is correct. If the output is correct, the test will pass. If the output is incorrect, the test will fail.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `median` is a simple function that takes a list of numbers and returns the median of the numbers. The function is tested using the doctest module. The tests are written in the docstring of the function and are executed when the function is imported. The tests are written in a format called \"doctest\" and are executed by the doctest module. The doctest module will run the tests and check if the output is correct. If the output is correct, the test will pass. If the output is incorrect, the test will fail.\n\n### References:\n- [doctest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)\n- [doctest format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest-docstrings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
