The function first splits the string into words using the split() method. It then creates an empty list to store the ordered words. It then loops through each word in the list of words. For each word, it sorts the characters in the word using the sorted() function and joins the sorted characters back into a string using the join() method. It then appends the ordered word to the list of ordered words. Finally, it joins the ordered words back into a string with spaces between them using the join() method. The ordered string is then returned.\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hi')) # 'Hi'\nprint(anti_shuffle('hello')) # 'ehllo'\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')) # 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n```\n\n### Output:\n```python\nHi\nehllo\nHello !!!Wdlor\n```\n\n### Time Complexity:\nThe time complexity of the anti_shuffle function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function first splits the string into words, which takes O(n) time, and then sorts each word, which takes O(n log n) time. The join() method used in the function also takes O(n) time, so the total time complexity is O(n log n).\n\n### Space Complexity:\nThe space complexity of the anti_shuffle function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function creates a list of ordered words, which can have a maximum length of n. The join() method used in the function also takes O(n) space, so the total space complexity is O(n).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe anti_shuffle function takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it. The function sorts the characters in each word and joins them back into a string, and then sorts the words and joins them back into a string with spaces between them. The time complexity of the function is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
