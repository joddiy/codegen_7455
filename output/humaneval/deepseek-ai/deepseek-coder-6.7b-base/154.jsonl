If they are not, it returns False.\n\nThe function then converts the two strings into lists of characters.\n\nThe function then iterates through the list of characters in the first string. For each iteration, it checks if the list of characters in the first string is equal to the list of characters in the second string. If they are equal, it returns True.\n\nIf the list of characters in the first string is not equal to the list of characters in the second string, the function rotates the list of characters in the second string by one position to the left. This is done by removing the first character from the list and appending it to the end of the list.\n\nIf the function completes the iteration without finding a match, it returns False.\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
