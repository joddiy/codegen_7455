If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, the function orders them based on their index in the original list.\n\nThe function first creates a dictionary `nums_dict` where the keys are the integers in the input list and the values are the sum of their digits. It then sorts the dictionary by the values (i.e., the sum of their digits) using the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key. The `sorted` function returns a list of tuples where the first element is the key and the second element is the value. The `dict` function is used to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary. Finally, the function returns a list of the keys of the sorted dictionary.\n\n### Test Cases:\n\n```python\n>>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\nTrue\n>>> order_by_points([]) == []\nTrue\n```\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\nThe time complexity of the `order_by_points` function is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list. This is because the `sorted` function used in the function is a built-in function that uses the Timsort algorithm, which has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.\n\n### Space Complexity:\n\nThe space complexity of the `order_by_points` function is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list. This is because the function creates a dictionary `nums_dict` that stores the sum of the digits of each integer in the input list. The `sorted` function also creates a new list of tuples, which has a space complexity of `O(n)`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe `order_by_points` function sorts a list of integers in ascending order according to the sum of their digits. If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, the function orders them based on their index in the original list. The function has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list.\n\n### References:\n\n- [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)\n- [Python sorted function](https://docs.python.org/3/", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
