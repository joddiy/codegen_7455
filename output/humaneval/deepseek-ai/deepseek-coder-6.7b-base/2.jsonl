{"task_id": "HumanEval/2", "completion": "\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    return number % 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe `%` operator is used to get the remainder of a division. In this case, we are dividing the number by 1 and returning the remainder.\n\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\ndef test_truncate_number():\n    assert truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5\n    assert truncate_number(3.0) == 0.0\n    assert truncate_number(3.9) == 0.9\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem was pretty straightforward. I used the `%` operator to get the remainder of the division. I then returned the remainder.\n\n\n### References:\n- [Python Modulo Operator](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_modulus.asp)\n- [Python Assert Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp)\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
