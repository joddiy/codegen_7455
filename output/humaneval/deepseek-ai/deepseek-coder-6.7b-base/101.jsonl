It takes an optional argument, `sep`, which specifies the delimiter to use for splitting the string. If `sep` is not provided, the method will split the string on whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.\n\nIn this case, the input string is split on whitespace characters and the resulting list of substrings is returned.\n\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nassert words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\nassert words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThis solution works by using the `split()` method to split the input string on whitespace characters and returning the resulting list of substrings. The `assert` statements are used to test the function with different input strings and expected output lists.\n\n\n### Reflection:\nThis solution works by using the `split()` method to split the input string on whitespace characters and returning the resulting list of substrings.
