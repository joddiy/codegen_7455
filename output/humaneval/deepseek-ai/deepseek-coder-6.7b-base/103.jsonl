{"task_id": "HumanEval/103", "completion": "\n```python\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        avg = (n + m) / 2\n        rounded_avg = round(avg)\n        binary = bin(rounded_avg)\n        return binary\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes two positive integers n and m as input. If n is greater than m, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m) and rounds it to the nearest integer. The rounded average is then converted to binary using the bin() function. The binary representation is returned as a string.\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nprint(rounded_avg(1, 5)) # Output: \"0b11\"\nprint(rounded_avg(7, 5)) # Output: -1\nprint(rounded_avg(10, 20)) # Output: \"0b1111\"\nprint(rounded_avg(20, 33)) # Output: \"0b11010\"\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n0b11\n-1\n0b1111\n0b11010\n```\n\n### Time Complexity:\nThe time complexity of the rounded_avg function is O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.\n\n### Space Complexity:\nThe space complexity of the rounded_avg function is O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis solution provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the rounded average of two positive integers and convert it to binary. It is suitable for small inputs and does not require any additional memory or resources.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
