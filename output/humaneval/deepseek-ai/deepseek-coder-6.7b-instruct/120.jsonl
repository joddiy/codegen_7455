{"task_id": "HumanEval/120", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution using the built-in `heapq` module to create a max heap. The heap is used to keep track of the k largest elements in the array.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef maximum(arr, k):\n    # Use heapq to create a max heap\n    heap = []\n    for num in arr:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, -num)\n\n    # Pop the largest k elements from the heap\n    result = []\n    for _ in range(k):\n        result.append(-heapq.heappop(heap))\n\n    # Sort the result as per the problem statement\n    result.sort()\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution works by first pushing all elements of the array into a max heap. The heap is implemented as a list in Python, where the first element is the largest. The `heappush` function is used to push an element onto the heap, and the `heappop` function is used to pop the largest element from the heap.\n\nThe largest k elements are then popped from the heap and appended to the result list. The result list is then sorted and returned.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(n) for the heap.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement mentions that the elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000]. However, the heapq module in Python only supports min heap, so we need to push the negative of the numbers into the heap to simulate a max heap.\n\nAlso, the problem statement mentions that the length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000]. This is already handled by the constraints in the problem description.\n\nLastly, the problem statement mentions that 0 <= k <= len(arr) is true. This is also handled by the constraints in the problem description.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
