{"task_id": "HumanEval/72", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef will_it_fly(q, w):\n    # Check if the list is palindromic\n    if q != q[::-1]:\n        return False\n    # Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight\n    if sum(q) <= w:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list `q` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If they are not the same, it returns `False`. Then it checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to `w`. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use this function:\n\n```python\nprint(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # Output: False\nprint(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # Output: False\nprint(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # Output: True\nprint(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # Output: True\n```\n\nAs expected, the function returns `False` for the first two cases, and `True` for the last two.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
