When it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the last opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty when it encounters a closing bracket, it means there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty after going through all the brackets, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False.\n\nThe function `correct_bracketing` returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and False otherwise.\n\nThis script uses the Python built-in `list` as a stack. The `append()` method is used to add an element to the end of the list (which is the top of the stack), and the `pop()` method is used to remove the last element from the list (which is the top of the stack). The `not` operator is used to check if the stack is empty.\n\nThe `print` statements at the end are used to test the function with the examples provided in the problem statement.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
