The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs.\n\n```python\ndef find_zero(xs: list):\n    assert len(xs) % 2 == 0, \"Number of coefficients must be even\"\n    assert xs[-1] != 0, \"Largest coefficient must be non-zero\"\n\n    def poly(x: float):\n        return sum(coeff * x ** i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs))\n\n    a, b = -1000, 1000  # initial guesses\n    while poly(a) * poly(b) > 0:  # if f(a) and f(b) have the same sign, try a different interval\n        a, b = b, b + 100\n    while abs(poly(a)) > 1e-6:  # continue until f(a) is close to zero\n        c = (a + b) / 2  # find midpoint\n        if poly(c) == 0:\n            return c\n        if poly(a) * poly(c) < 0:  # if f(a) and f(c) have different signs, then the root is between a and c\n            b = c\n        else:  # else the root is between c and b\n            a = c\n    return a\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `poly` that evaluates the polynomial at a given point, and a function `find_zero` that uses the bisection method to find a root of the polynomial. The bisection method starts with two initial guesses for the root, and then iteratively refines the guess until the root is found.\n\nThe `find_zero` function also checks that the list of coefficients has an even length and that the largest coefficient is non-zero, as these conditions are necessary for the bisection method to converge.\n\nThe `poly` function is defined inside `find_zero` to ensure that it uses the coefficients of the polynomial at the time `find_zero` is called. This is necessary because the coefficients of the polynomial can change between calls to `find_zero`.\n\nThe `find_zero` function returns the root of the polynomial as a floating-point number.\n\nNote: The bisection method may not always converge to the correct root, especially for polynomials with many roots or for polynomials with roots very close together.
