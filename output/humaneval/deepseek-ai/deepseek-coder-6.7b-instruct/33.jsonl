It then sorts this list. Finally, it replaces the elements at indices divisible by 3 in the original list with the sorted elements.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\nprint(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n```\n\nThis script works by first creating a list of elements at indices divisible by 3, sorting this list, and then replacing the elements at indices divisible by 3 in the original list with the sorted elements.\n\nThe time complexity of this script is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the list of elements at indices divisible by 3.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
