For each pair of scores and guesses, it calculates the absolute difference and appends it to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nprint(compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]))  # Output: [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]\n```\n\nThese outputs match the expected results from the problem statement.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    \n    example:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef compare(game, guess):\n    result = []\n    for g, h in zip(game, guess):\n        result.append(abs(g - h))\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the two input lists simultaneously using the `zip` function.
