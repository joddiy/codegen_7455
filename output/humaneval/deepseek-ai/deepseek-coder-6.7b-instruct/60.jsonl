{"task_id": "HumanEval/60", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n: int):\n    return sum(range(1, n+1))\n\nprint(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465\nprint(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050\nprint(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nIn this script, the `sum_to_n` function uses the built-in `sum` function and `range` function to sum all numbers from 1 to `n`. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive), and the `sum` function adds up all the numbers in this sequence.\n\nThe `range` function takes two arguments: the start and the stop. If we only provide one argument, it starts from 0 by default. So we need to add 1 to `n` to make it inclusive.\n\nThe script then tests the `sum_to_n` function with different values of `n` and prints the results.\n\nNote: This script uses Python's built-in `sum` and `range` functions, which are efficient and easy to use.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement in the question is incorrect. The sum of numbers from 1 to n should be calculated using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. The corrected code would be:\n\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n: int):\n    return n * (n+1) // 2\n\nprint(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465\nprint(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050\nprint(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThis code uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is more efficient for large values of `n`.\n\nPlease note that the `//` operator is used for division in Python 3, which returns an integer result. If you are using Python 2, you should use `/` for division.\n\nAlso, please note that the problem statement in the question is incorrect. The sum of numbers from 1 to n should be calculated using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. The corrected code would be:\n\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n: int):\n    return n * (n+1) // 2\n\nprint(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465\nprint(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050\nprint(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThis code uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is more efficient for large values of `n`.\n\nPlease note that the `//` operator is used for division in Python 3, which returns an integer result.
