It then iterates over the string at even indices (using `range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0`), and for each character, it checks if it is an uppercase vowel (using `s[i] in vowels`).

The final count is then returned.\n\nThe test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function with various inputs.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
