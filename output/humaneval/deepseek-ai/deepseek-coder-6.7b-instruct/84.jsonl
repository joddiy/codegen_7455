It then calculates the sum of the digits in the binary representation. Finally, it converts this sum back to binary and returns it.\n\nFor example, if you call `solve(1000)`, it will return `'1'`, `solve(150)` will return `'110'`, and `solve(147)` will return `'1100'`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
