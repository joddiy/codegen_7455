Then, we split the input sentence into words and use a list comprehension to filter out the words whose lengths are prime numbers. Finally, we join the prime words with a space and return the result.\n\nThe helper function `is_prime(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of words in the sentence and m is the average length of the words. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words in the sentence.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement does not specify what to do if there are multiple words with the same length. In this solution, we keep the order of the words as they appear in the original sentence. If you want to change this behavior, you can modify the list comprehension to sort the words by their lengths before filtering them.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
