It then calculates the range of the numbers (maximum minus minimum). The function then returns a new list where each number is transformed by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range. This rescales the numbers so that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.\n\nWhen you run this script with the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`, it will output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`, which is the expected result.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
