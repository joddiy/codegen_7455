{"task_id": "HumanEval/66", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef digitSum(s):\n    return sum(ord(c) for c in s if c.isupper())\n\nprint(digitSum(\"\"))        # => 0\nprint(digitSum(\"abAB\"))    # => 131\nprint(digitSum(\"abcCd\"))   # => 67\nprint(digitSum(\"helloE\"))  # => 69\nprint(digitSum(\"woArBld\")) # => 131\nprint(digitSum(\"aAaaaXa\")) # => 153\n```\n\nIn this solution, we use the built-in Python function `ord()` to get the ASCII value of a character. We use a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string `s`, and only add the ASCII value of the character to the sum if it is an uppercase letter (checked using the `isupper()` method).\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string only contains alphabetic characters. If the string can contain non-alphabetic characters, you should adjust the condition in the generator expression accordingly.\n\nNote: The ASCII value of uppercase letters ranges from 65 to 90 (inclusive), and the ASCII value of lowercase letters ranges from 97 to 122 (inclusive).\n\nThis solution is case sensitive. If you want to ignore case, you can modify the condition in the generator expression to `c.isupper() or c.islower()`.\n\nThis solution is case sensitive.
