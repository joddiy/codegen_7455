{"task_id": "HumanEval/86", "completion": "\nHere is the Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    ordered_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(ordered_words)\n\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # returns 'Hi'\nprint(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # returns 'ehllo'\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n```\n\nThis script works by first splitting the input string into a list of words. Then it sorts each word alphabetically and joins them back together with spaces in between. The result is a string where all words are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on ASCII value.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string only contains alphabets and spaces. If the input string can contain other characters, you would need to add additional logic to handle those characters.\n\nAlso, this solution is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can modify the sorted function to use the lowercase version of the string.\n\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    ordered_words = [''.join(sorted(word, key=str.lower)) for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(ordered_words)\n\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the sorted function uses the lowercase version of the string as the key for sorting. This means that it will consider 'a' and 'A' as the same character when sorting.\n\nThis solution should work for most cases, but if you have a specific edge case you're interested in, please let me know and I'll be happy to help you solve it.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
