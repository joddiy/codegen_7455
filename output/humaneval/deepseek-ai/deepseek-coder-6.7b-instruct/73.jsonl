If they are not equal, it increments a counter. The function finally returns the counter, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]))  # Output: 4\nprint(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1\nprint(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nAs expected, the function returns the correct number of changes for each test case.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

A palindromic array is an array that\n    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.\n\n    For example:\n    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    changes = 0\n    for i in range(n//2):\n        if arr[i] != arr[n-i-1]:\n            changes += 1\n    return changes\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first half of the array and comparing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the array.
