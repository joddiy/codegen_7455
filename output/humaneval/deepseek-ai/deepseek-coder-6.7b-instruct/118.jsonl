Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between \n    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).\n    \n    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't\n    find any vowel met the above condition. \n\n    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.\n\n    Example:\n    get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\") ==> \"u\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\") ==> \"U\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"quick\") ==> \"\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"ab\") ==> \"\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):\n        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:\n            return word[i]\n    return \"\"\n\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\"))  # Output: \"u\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\"))  # Output: \"U\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"quick\"))  # Output: \"\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"ab\"))  # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over the string from right to left (excluding the first and last characters).
