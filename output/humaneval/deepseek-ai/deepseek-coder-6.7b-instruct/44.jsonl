The function works by dividing `x` by the base and recursively calling itself with the quotient until the quotient is less than the base. The remainder of each division is then converted to a string and concatenated to form the final result.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the input number `x` is non-negative and the base is between 2 and 10 (inclusive). If these conditions are not met, the script may not work as expected.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
