Then it iterates over the sorted list, calculating the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and the pair of numbers that produced this difference. Finally, it returns the pair of numbers that produced the minimum difference.\n\nThe output of this script is:\n\n```\n(2.0, 2.2)\n(2.0, 2.0)\n```\n\nThis means that in the first case, the two numbers that are closest to each other are 2.0 and 2.2.
