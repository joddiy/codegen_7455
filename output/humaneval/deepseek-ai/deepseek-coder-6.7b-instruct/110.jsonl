{"task_id": "HumanEval/110", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    odd_lst1 = [x for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0]\n    even_lst2 = [x for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0]\n    if len(odd_lst1) <= len(even_lst2):\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n```\n\nThis solution works by first creating two lists: `odd_lst1` which contains all the odd numbers in `lst1` and `even_lst2` which contains all the even numbers in `lst2`. Then it checks if the number of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in `lst2`. If it is, it means it's possible to exchange elements between `lst1` and `lst2` to make all the elements of `lst1` even, so it returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nLet's test the function with your examples:\n\n```python\nprint(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: \"YES\"\nprint(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # Output: \"NO\"\n```\n\nAs expected, the function returns \"YES\" for the first case and \"NO\" for the second case.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
