If the character is an open parenthesis, it increments an open counter. If the character is a close parenthesis, it increments a close counter. If the close counter ever exceeds the open counter, it means there are more close parentheses than open parentheses, so the string cannot be good, and the function returns 'No'. After iterating over all strings and characters, if the open counter equals the close counter, the resulting string will be good, and the function returns 'Yes'. If the open counter is greater than the close counter, the string can still be good by closing the remaining open parentheses, so the function returns 'Yes'.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string\n    '())' is not.\n    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'\n    '''\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    # Initialize counters for open and close parentheses\n    open_count = 0\n    close_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each string in the list\n    for string in lst:\n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in string:\n            # If the character is an open parenthesis, increment the open counter\n            if char == '(':\n                open_count += 1\n            # If the character is a close parenthesis, increment the close counter\n            elif char == ')':\n                close_count += 1\n\n            # If we have more close parentheses than open parentheses,\n            # we cannot make a good string, so return 'No'\n            if close_count > open_count:\n                return 'No'\n\n    # If the number of open and close parentheses are equal,\n    # the resulting string will be good, so return 'Yes'\n    if open_count == close_count:\n        return 'Yes'\n    # If the number of open parentheses is greater than the number of close parentheses,\n    # we can still make a good string by closing the remaining open parentheses,\n    # so return 'Yes'\n    else:\n        return 'Yes'\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each string in the list and then over each character in the string.
