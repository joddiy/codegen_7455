It initializes the first four elements of the list to the base cases of the fib4 sequence. Then it fills the rest of the list using a loop that iterates from 4 to `n`, updating each element as the sum of the previous four elements. Finally, it returns the `n-th` element of the list.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), which makes it efficient for large values of `n`.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(fib4(5))  # Output: 4\nprint(fib4(6))  # Output: 8\nprint(fib4(7))  # Output: 14\n```\n\nThis will print the first five numbers in the fib4 sequence, as expected.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
