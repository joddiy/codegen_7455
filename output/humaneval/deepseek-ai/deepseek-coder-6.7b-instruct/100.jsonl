{"task_id": "HumanEval/100", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    stones = [n]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            stones.append(n + 2*i)\n        else:\n            stones.append(n + 2*i)\n    return stones\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `make_a_pile(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` and returns a list of the number of stones in each level of a pile of stones. The first level has `n` stones. The number of stones in each subsequent level is the next odd or even number, depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively.\n\nThe function works by initializing a list `stones` with `n` as the first element. It then enters a loop that iterates `n - 1` times. In each iteration, it calculates the number of stones in the next level and appends this number to `stones`. The number of stones in the next level is calculated as `n + 2*i`, where `i` is the current level (0-indexed). If `n` is even, the number of stones in the next level is `n + 2*i`; if `n` is odd, the number of stones in the next level is `n + 2*i`. The function finally returns `stones`.\n\nHere is how you can test the function:\n\n```python\nprint(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]\n```\n\nThis will print the list `[3, 5, 7]`, which is the expected output.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
