The function initializes two variables `total_sum` and `total_product` to 0 and 1 respectively. Then it iterates over the input list, adding each number to `total_sum` and multiplying it with `total_product`. Finally, it returns a tuple of `total_sum` and `total_product`.\n\nThe script then tests the function with an empty list and a list of integers.\n\nPlease note that the product of an empty list is defined to be 1 (as there are no elements to multiply), so the function will return (0, 1) for an empty list.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
