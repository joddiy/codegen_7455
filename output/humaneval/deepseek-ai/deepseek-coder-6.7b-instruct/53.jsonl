{"task_id": "HumanEval/53", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers x and y\n    >>> add(2, 3)\n    5\n    >>> add(5, 7)\n    12\n    \"\"\"\n    return x + y\n```\n\nYou can run this script in a Python environment to test it. If you run the `add(2, 3)` line, it will return `5`, and if you run the `add(5, 7)` line, it will return `12`.\n\nThis script defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`, both of which are integers. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`. The type hint `-> int` indicates that the function returns an integer. The docstring at the beginning of the function provides examples of how to use the function.\n\nYou can run the examples in the docstring by copying the code into a Python environment and running it.\n```python\nprint(add(2, 3))  # Outputs: 5\nprint(add(5, 7))  # Outputs: 12\n```\n\nThis will print the results of the `add` function to the console.\n\nPlease note that the examples in the docstring are not run automatically.
