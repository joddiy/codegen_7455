{"task_id": "HumanEval/62", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    # Remove the first coefficient as it's the constant term and its derivative is always 0\n    xs = xs[1:]\n    # Multiply each coefficient by its corresponding power and decrease the power by 1\n    xs = [i*x for i, x in enumerate(xs)]\n    return xs\n```\n\nThis script works by first removing the first coefficient from the list, as the constant term of a polynomial has no derivative. Then it multiplies each coefficient by its corresponding power (which is its index in the list), and decreases the power by 1. This is the standard formula for the derivative of a polynomial.\n\nFor example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the script first removes the first coefficient, which is 3. Then it multiplies the second coefficient (1) by 1 (its power), and the third coefficient (2) by 2, and so on. The result is `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which is the derivative of the original polynomial.\n\nIf the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the script first removes the first coefficient, which is 1. Then it multiplies the second coefficient (2) by 1 (its power), and the third coefficient (3) by 2.
