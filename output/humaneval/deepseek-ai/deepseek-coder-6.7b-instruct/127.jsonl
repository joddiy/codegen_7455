If the intervals don't intersect, it returns \"NO\". Otherwise, it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it is a prime number.

For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)\n    includes both start and end.\n    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.\n    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two \n    intervals is a prime number.\n    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n    otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    If the two intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\n\n\n    [input/output] samples:\n    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> \"YES\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    # find the intersection of the two intervals\n    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])\n    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])\n    \n    # if the intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\"\n    if start > end:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # calculate the length of the intersection\n    length = end - start + 1\n    \n    # check if the length is a prime number\n    if length < 2:\n        return \"NO\"\n    for i in range(2, int(length ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if length % i == 0:\n            return \"NO\"\n    return \"YES\"\n```\n\nThis solution first calculates the intersection of the two intervals.
