For each group, it iterates over each character. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increments a count and updates the maximum count if the count is greater. If it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decrements the count. The maximum count at any point is the depth of the deepest nesting in the group. This maximum count is appended to the result list.
