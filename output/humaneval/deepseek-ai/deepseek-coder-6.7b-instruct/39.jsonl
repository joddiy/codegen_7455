The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime, and the `fibonacci` function generates the nth Fibonacci number. The `prime_fib` function generates Fibonacci numbers until it finds a prime number, and then returns that number.\n\nPlease note that this script may take a while to run for large inputs due to the nature of the problem.\n\nAlso, please note that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the first prime number is 2.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on. The first few prime Fibonacci numbers are 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, and so on.\n\nThe prime Fibonacci sequence is not defined in the usual mathematical sense, but it can be interpreted as the sequence of Fibonacci numbers that are also prime.\n\nThis script is a simple implementation and may not be the most efficient for large inputs. If you need to work with large inputs, you may want to consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
