It converts the string to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then converts it to a set. A set in Python is a collection of unique elements, so this will automatically remove any duplicate characters. Finally, it returns the length of the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.\n\nThe test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function with two different inputs.\n\nNote: This function does not count spaces or punctuation as characters. If you want to count them as well, you can modify the function to remove or ignore these characters before converting the string to a set.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
