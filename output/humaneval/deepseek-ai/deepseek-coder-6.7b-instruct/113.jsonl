{"task_id": "HumanEval/113", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef odd_count(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i, s in enumerate(lst):\n        count = sum(1 for c in s if int(c) % 2 != 0)\n        result.append(f\"the number of odd elements {count}n the str{count}ng {count} of the {count}nput.\")\n    return result\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `odd_count` that takes a list of strings as input. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the output. It then iterates over the input list, for each string `s` in the list, it counts the number of odd digits in `s` by summing up 1 for each character `c` in `s` that is not divisible by 2 (i.e., is odd). It then appends a string to `result` that includes this count, formatted as per the problem statement. Finally, it returns `result`.\n\nHere is how you can test this function:\n\n```python\nprint(odd_count(['1234567']))\nprint(odd_count(['3', '11111111']))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\"]\n[\"the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.\"]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected output from the problem statement.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
