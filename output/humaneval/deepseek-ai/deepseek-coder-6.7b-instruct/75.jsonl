It then iterates over all numbers from 2 to `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by the current number and if it is prime. If it is, it is added to the list of factors and `n` is divided by the factor. If there are more than 3 factors or `n` becomes 1, the loop breaks. Finally, it returns whether the number of factors is 3 and the last factor is prime.\n\nThe function `is_multiply_prime(n)` checks if `n` is the product of exactly 3 prime numbers. It does this by first finding all prime factors of `n` and storing them in a list. It then checks if the number of factors is 3 and if the last factor is prime. If both conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThe script then tests the function with the example given in the problem statement.\n\nPlease note that the function `is_multiply_prime(n)` will return `False` for `n=30` because `30` is not a product of exactly 3 prime numbers. The correct product of 3 prime numbers that multiply to `30` is `2*3*5`.\n\nSo, the correct output for `is_multiply_prime(30)` should be `False`.\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
