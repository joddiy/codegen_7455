{"task_id": "HumanEval/146", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef specialFilter(nums):\n    count = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num > 10 and str(abs(num))[0] in '13579' and str(abs(num))[-1] in '13579':\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nIn this solution, we iterate over each number in the input list. For each number, we first check if it is greater than 10. If it is, we then convert it to an absolute value (to handle negative numbers) and convert it to a string. We then check if the first and last characters of this string are in the set of odd digits ('1', '3', '5', '7', '9'). If both conditions are met, we increment our count. Finally, we return the count.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]))  # Output: 1\nprint(specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis will output the expected results.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
