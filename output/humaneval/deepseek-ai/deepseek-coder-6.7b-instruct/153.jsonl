The\n    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase\n    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters \n    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. \n    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this \n    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\n    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should\n    choose the one that comes first in the list.\n    For example, if you are given \"Slices\" as the class and a list of the\n    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should\n    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension \n    (its strength is -1).\n    Example:\n    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n    strongest_extension = extensions[0]\n    strongest_strength = sum([1 for c in extensions[0] if c.isupper()]) - sum([1 for c in extensions[0] if c.islower()])\n\n    for extension in extensions[1:]:\n        strength = sum([1 for c in extension if c.isupper()]) - sum([1 for c in extension if c.islower()])\n        if strength > strongest_strength:\n            strongest_extension = extension\n            strongest_strength = strength\n\n    return f\"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}\"\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each extension in the list, calculating its strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters.
