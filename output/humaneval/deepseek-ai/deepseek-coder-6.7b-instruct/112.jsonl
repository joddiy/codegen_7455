{"task_id": "HumanEval/112", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_delete(s, c):\n    # Delete all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n    for char in c:\n        s = s.replace(char, '')\n\n    # Check if the result string is palindrome\n    is_palindrome = s == s[::-1]\n\n    return (s, is_palindrome)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\"))  # should return ('bcd', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdef\", \"b\"))  # should return ('acdef', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdedcba\", \"ab\"))  # should return ('cdedc', True)\n```\n\nThis script works by first iterating over each character in the string `c` and replacing all instances of that character in the string `s` with an empty string. This effectively deletes all instances of those characters from `s`. Then it checks if the resulting string is the same as its reverse. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function returns a tuple containing the resulting string and the boolean value.\n\nPlease note that the function `replace()` is case sensitive. If you want to ignore case, you can modify the function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_delete(s, c):\n    s = s.lower()\n    c = c.lower()\n    for char in c:\n        s = s.replace(char, '')\n    is_palindrome = s == s[::-1]\n    return (s, is_palindrome)\n```\n\nThis version of the function converts both `s` and `c` to lowercase before starting the process.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
