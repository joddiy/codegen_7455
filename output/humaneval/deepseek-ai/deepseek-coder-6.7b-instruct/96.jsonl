It then uses this helper function in the `count_up_to(n)` function to find all prime numbers less than `n`.\n\nThe `is_prime(num)` function works by checking if `num` is divisible by any number less than `num` and greater than 1. If `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, and the function returns `False`. If `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe `count_up_to(n)` function works by iterating over all numbers from 2 to `n` (exclusive), checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime(num)` function, and if it is, adding it to the list of prime numbers. The function then returns this list.\n\nNote that this script assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is not a non-negative integer, the script may not behave as expected.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
