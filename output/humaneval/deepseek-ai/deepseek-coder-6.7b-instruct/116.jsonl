{"task_id": "HumanEval/116", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n\nprint(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\nprint(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nIn this script, the `sorted` function is used to sort the array. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element of the array and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the key is a tuple `(bin(x).count('1'), x)`. This means that the elements are sorted first by the number of ones in their binary representation (`bin(x).count('1')`), and then by their decimal value (`x`).\n\nThe `bin` function is used to convert a number to its binary representation as a string. The `count` method of a string is used to count the number of ones in the binary representation.\n\nThe `lambda` function is a small anonymous function that is used to define a function on the fly. In this case, it is used to define a function that takes a number and returns a tuple `(bin(x).count('1'), x)`.\n\nThe `sorted` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of the array. The original array is not modified.\n\nThe `print` statements are used to test the function.\n\nNote: The `sorted` function is stable, which means that it maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys. This is why the decimal value is used as the second sort key to sort the elements with the same number of ones in their binary representation.\n\nAlso, please note that the `bin` function in Python returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it is a binary number, so the count of '1' in the binary representation of negative numbers will be incorrect. If you want to sort negative numbers, you should convert them to their absolute values first.\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))\n```\n\nThis version of the function will sort negative numbers correctly.\n\n```python\nprint(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n```\n\nThis will sort the array in ascending order.\n\n```python\nprint(sort_array([-1, -5, -2, -3, -4]))  # [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]\n```\n\nThis will sort the array in ascending order.\n\n```python\nprint(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThis will sort the array in ascending order.\n\n```python\nprint(sort_array([0, -1, -5, -", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
