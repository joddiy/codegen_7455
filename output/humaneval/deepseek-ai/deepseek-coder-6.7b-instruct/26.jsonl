This ensures that each number is only added once, effectively removing any duplicates. The order of the numbers in the original list is preserved in the new list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided example:\n\n```python\nprint(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nThis will output `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is the list with all duplicates removed.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
