It first checks if there are more than three digits in the file name. If there are, it returns 'No'. Then it checks if there is exactly one dot in the file name. If not, it returns 'No'. After that, it splits the file name into two parts: the name part before the dot and the extension part after the dot. It checks if the name part is not empty and starts with a letter. If not, it returns 'No'. Finally, it checks if the extension is one of the allowed ones. If not, it returns 'No'. If all the conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
