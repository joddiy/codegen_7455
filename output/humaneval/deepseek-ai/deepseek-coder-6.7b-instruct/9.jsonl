{"task_id": "HumanEval/9", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    max_numbers = []\n    max_num = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n        max_numbers.append(max_num)\n    return max_numbers\n\nprint(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))\n```\n\nThis script initializes an empty list `max_numbers` and a variable `max_num` to the first number in the input list. Then it iterates over the input list. If the current number is greater than `max_num`, it updates `max_num` to the current number. After that, it appends `max_num` to `max_numbers`. Finally, it returns `max_numbers`.\n\nWhen you run this script with the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, it will output `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]`, which is the list of rolling maximum elements found until each moment in the sequence.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
