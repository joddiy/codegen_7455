{"task_id": "HumanEval/125", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef split_words(txt):\n    if ' ' in txt:\n        return txt.split(' ')\n    elif ',' in txt:\n        return txt.split(',')\n    else:\n        return sum(1 for ch in txt if ch.islower() and (ord(ch) - ord('a')) % 2 != 0)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(split_words(\"Hello world!\"))  # \u279e [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprint(split_words(\"Hello,world!\"))  # \u279e [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprint(split_words(\"abcdef\"))  # \u279e 3\n```\n\nThis script works by first checking if there are any spaces in the input string. If there are, it splits the string on the spaces and returns the resulting list of words. If there are no spaces, it then checks for commas. If there are commas, it splits the string on the commas and returns the resulting list of words. If there are no spaces or commas, it counts the number of lower-case letters in the string with an odd order in the alphabet and returns this count.\n\nThe function `ord(ch) - ord('a')` gives the position of a character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If this position is odd (`% 2 != 0`), the character is counted.\n\nThe `sum(1 for ch in txt if ch.islower() and (ord(ch) - ord('a')) % 2 != 0)` part of the function counts the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet. The `for ch in txt` part of the sum iterates over each character in the string. The `if ch.islower() and (ord(ch) - ord('a')) % 2 != 0` part of the sum checks if the character is a lower-case letter and if its position in the alphabet is odd. If both conditions are true, the character is counted. The `1`s are added to the sum for each such character. The `sum` function then adds up all these `1`s to get the total count.\n\nThe test cases at the end of the script demonstrate that the function works as expected.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
