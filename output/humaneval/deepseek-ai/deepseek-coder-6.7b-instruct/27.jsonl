{"task_id": "HumanEval/27", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef flip_case(string: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.\n    >>> flip_case('Hello')\n    'hELLO'\n    \"\"\"\n    flipped_string = \"\"\n    for char in string:\n        if char.isupper():\n            flipped_string += char.lower()\n        else:\n            flipped_string += char.upper()\n    return flipped_string\n\nprint(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns a new string where all uppercase characters are converted to lowercase and all lowercase characters are converted to uppercase. It does this by iterating over each character in the input string and checking if it is uppercase or lowercase using the `isupper` method. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase using the `lower` method, and if it is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase using the `upper` method. The flipped characters are then concatenated into a new string, which is returned as the result.\n\nYou can test this function with the example provided in the problem statement.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string only contains alphabetic characters and does not contain any non-alphabetic characters. If the input string can contain non-alphabetic characters, you would need to add additional logic to handle those characters appropriately.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
