{"task_id": "HumanEval/138", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\"\"\"\n    if n < 8:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return n % 4 == 0\n```\n\nThis script works by checking if the given number `n` is less than 8. If it is, it returns `False` because it's impossible for `n` to be the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If `n` is 8 or greater, it checks if `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder. If `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If `n` is not divisible by 4 with no remainder, it returns `False`.\n\nHere are some examples of how this function works:\n\n```python\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # True\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(12))  # True\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(14))  # False\n```\n\nIn these examples, `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` returns `False` because 4 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` returns `False` because 6 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` returns `True` because 8 can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 2 + 2). `is_equal_to_sum_even(12)` returns `True` because 12 can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 4 + 4). `is_equal_to_sum_even(14)` returns `False` because 14 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
