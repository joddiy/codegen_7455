{"task_id": "HumanEval/91", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    # Split the string into sentences\n    sentences = [sentence.strip() for sentence in re.split('[.?!]', S) if sentence]\n\n    # Initialize the count of boredoms\n    boredom_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the sentences\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        # If the sentence starts with \"I\", increment the count\n        if sentence.startswith('I'):\n            boredom_count += 1\n\n    return boredom_count\n```\n\nIn this script, we first split the input string into sentences using the `re.split()` function. We then iterate over the sentences and increment a counter if the sentence starts with \"I\". Finally, we return the count.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(is_bored(\"Hello world\"))  # Output: 0\nprint(is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\"))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThis script assumes that the input string `S` does not contain any punctuation other than '.', '?' and '!' as sentence delimiters. If there are other punctuation marks that could be used as sentence delimiters, you would need to adjust the regular expression used in the `re.split()` function accordingly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    # Split the string into sentences\n    sentences = [sentence.strip() for sentence in re.split('[.?!]', S) if sentence]\n\n    # Initialize the count of boredoms\n    boredom_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the sentences\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        # If the sentence starts with \"I\", increment the count\n        if sentence.startswith('I'):\n            boredom_count += 1\n\n    return boredom_count\n```\n\nIn this script, we first split the input string into sentences using the `re.split()` function.
