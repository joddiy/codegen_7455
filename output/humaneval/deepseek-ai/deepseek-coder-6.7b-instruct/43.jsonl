If it is, we've found a pair that sums to zero, so we return True. If we go through the entire list without finding such a pair, we return False.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) because we're doing a single pass over the list, and a space complexity of O(n) because we're storing the elements we've seen in a set.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
