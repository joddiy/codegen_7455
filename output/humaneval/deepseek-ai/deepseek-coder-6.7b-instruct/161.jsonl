If it doesn't, we return the reversed string. If it does, we iterate over each character in the string, and if it's a lowercase letter, we convert it to uppercase, and if it's an uppercase letter, we convert it to lowercase. We then join these characters together into a new string and return it.\n\nThis solution uses the built-in `isalpha()` method to check if a character is a letter, the `upper()` and `lower()` methods to convert between uppercase and lowercase, and the `join()` method to combine a list of characters into a string. The `[::-1]` slice is used to reverse a string.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
