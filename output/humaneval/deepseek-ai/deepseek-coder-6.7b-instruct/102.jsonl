If \n    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n    For example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        for i in range(y, x-1, -1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                return i\n        return -1\n\nprint(choose_num(12, 15))  # Output: 14\nprint(choose_num(13, 12))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nIn this script, we start from the larger number `y` and go down to `x`.
