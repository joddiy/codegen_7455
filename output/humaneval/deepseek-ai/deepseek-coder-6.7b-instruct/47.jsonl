Then it checks if the length of the list is even or odd. If it's even, it calculates the median by averaging the two middle numbers. If it's odd, it returns the middle number.\n\nPlease note that the function `median` modifies the original list. If you don't want to modify the original list, you should make a copy of the list before sorting it.\n\nAlso, the function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list can be empty, you should add a check for this case.\n\nLastly, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric elements. You may want to add error checking to handle these cases, depending on your specific requirements.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
