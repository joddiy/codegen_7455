{"task_id": "HumanEval/149", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    # Remove strings with odd lengths\n    lst = [i for i in lst if len(i) % 2 == 0]\n    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically\n    lst.sort()\n    lst.sort(key=len)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis function first creates a new list that only includes the strings with even lengths. It then sorts the list first alphabetically and then by length. The sort function in Python is stable, so it will sort by the second criteria if there are any ties in the first.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]))  # Output: ['aa']\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]))  # Output: ['ab', 'cd']\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function works as expected.\n\nNote: The function assumes that all words will have the same length. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
