The `{2,}` in the regular expression means \"match two or more of the preceding character\". The `if` statements at the end are used to remove any underscores that may have been left at the beginning or end of the string.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(fix_spaces(\"Example\"))  # Outputs: \"Example\"\nprint(fix_spaces(\"Example 1\"))  # Outputs: \"Example_1\"\nprint(fix_spaces(\" Example 2\"))  # Outputs: \"_Example_2\"\nprint(fix_spaces(\" Example   3\"))  # Outputs: \"_Example-3\"\n```\n\nThis should give you the expected output.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
