The `bin` function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use slicing `[2:]` to remove the first two characters. Finally, we add the 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the binary string.\n\nYou can test this function with other decimal numbers to see how it works.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary\n    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.\n\n    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.\n    The extra characters are there to help with the format.\n\n    Examples:\n    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns \"db1111db\"\n    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns \"db100000db\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is the Python script for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]\n    return \"db\" + binary + \"db\"\n\nprint(decimal_to_binary(15))  # returns \"db1111db\"\nprint(decimal_to_binary(32))  # returns \"db100000db\"\n```\n\nThis script uses Python's built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal number to binary.
