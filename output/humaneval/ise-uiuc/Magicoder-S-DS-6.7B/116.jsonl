{"task_id": "HumanEval/116", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n```\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the array. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element from the array and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the function `lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x)` is used.\n\nThis function first calculates the number of ones in the binary representation of the number (`bin(x).count('1')`) and then returns a tuple consisting of this count and the original number (`x`).\n\nWhen sorting, Python first sorts by the first element of the tuple (the count of ones in the binary representation), and then by the second element (the original number). This ensures that numbers with the same number of ones in their binary representation are sorted by their decimal value.\n\nFor example, if you call `sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])`, it will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` because 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 one in their binary representation respectively, and 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
