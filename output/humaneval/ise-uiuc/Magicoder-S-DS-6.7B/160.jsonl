The first list has basic algebra operations, and \n    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric \n    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.\n\n    The basic algebra operations:\n    Addition ( + ) \n    Subtraction ( - ) \n    Multiplication ( * ) \n    Floor division ( // ) \n    Exponentiation ( ** ) \n\n    Example:\n    operator['+', '*', '-']\n    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n    => result = 9\n\n    Note:\n        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.\n        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.\n        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.\n\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operator, operand):\n    result = operand[0]\n    for i in range(len(operator)):\n        if operator[i] == '+':\n            result += operand[i+1]\n        elif operator[i] == '-':\n            result -= operand[i+1]\n        elif operator[i] == '*':\n            result *= operand[i+1]\n        elif operator[i] == '//':\n            result //= operand[i+1]\n        elif operator[i] == '**':\n            result **= operand[i+1]\n    return result\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `do_algebra` that takes two lists as input: `operator` and `operand`.
