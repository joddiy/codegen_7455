If `n` is odd, it multiplies `n` by 3 and adds 1. The result of this operation is then appended to the `collatz_sequence` list.

Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    collatz_sequence = [n]\n    while n != 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n // 2\n        else:\n            n = 3 * n + 1\n        collatz_sequence.append(n)\n    return sorted([i for i in collatz_sequence if i % 2 != 0])\n```\n\nThis script first creates a list with the input number `n`.
