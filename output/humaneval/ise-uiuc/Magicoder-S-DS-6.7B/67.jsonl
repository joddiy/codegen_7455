Given the string that represents the total number of \n    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits \n    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.\n    for examble:\n    fruit_distribution(\"5 apples and 6 oranges\", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8\n    fruit_distribution(\"0 apples and 1 oranges\",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2\n    fruit_distribution(\"2 apples and 3 oranges\", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95\n    fruit_distribution(\"100 apples and 1 oranges\",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef fruit_distribution(s,n):\n    # Split the string to get the number of apples and oranges\n    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split()[::2])\n    # Subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits\n    mangoes = n - apples - oranges\n    return mangoes\n\n# Test the function\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"5 apples and 6 oranges\", 19)) # Expected output: 8\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"0 apples and 1 oranges\",3)) # Expected output: 2\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"2 apples and 3 oranges\", 100)) # Expected output: 95\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"100 apples and 1 oranges\",120)) # Expected output: 19\n```\n\nThis script first splits the string to get the number of apples and oranges.
