Return the word with maximum number\n    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique\n    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.\n\n    find_max([\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"]) == \"string\"\n    find_max([\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"]) == \"enam\"\n    find_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\" ,\"cc\"]) == \"\"aaaaaaa\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(words):\n    max_unique_chars = 0\n    max_word = \"\"\n    for word in words:\n        unique_chars = len(set(word))\n        if unique_chars > max_unique_chars or (unique_chars == max_unique_chars and word < max_word):\n            max_unique_chars = unique_chars\n            max_word = word\n    return max_word\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each word in the list.
