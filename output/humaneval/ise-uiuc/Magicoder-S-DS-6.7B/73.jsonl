Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that\n    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.\n\n    For example:\n    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    changes = 0\n    for i in range(n//2):\n        if arr[i] != arr[n-i-1]:\n            changes += 1\n    return changes\n```\n\nThis function works by comparing the first and last elements of the array, the second and second last elements, and so on.
