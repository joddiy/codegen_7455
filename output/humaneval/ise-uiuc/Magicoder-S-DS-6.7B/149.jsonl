{"task_id": "HumanEval/149", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    # Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    lst = [word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]\n    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically\n    lst.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    return lst\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]))  # Output: ['aa']\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]))  # Output: ['ab', 'cd']\n```\n\nThis function works by first filtering out the strings with odd lengths using a list comprehension. Then it sorts the list by length and then alphabetically using the `sort` function with a custom sorting key. The `key` parameter of the `sort` function is a function that takes an element from the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the function returns a tuple `(len(x), x)`, where `len(x)` is the length of the string and `x` is the string itself. This ensures that the list is sorted first by length and then by alphabetical order.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    # Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    lst = [word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]\n    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically\n    lst.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    return lst\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]))  # Output: ['aa']\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]))  # Output: ['ab', 'cd']\n```\n\nThis function works by first filtering out the strings with odd lengths using a list comprehension.
