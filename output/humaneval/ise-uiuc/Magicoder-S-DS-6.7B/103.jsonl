Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    \"\"\"You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the\n    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). \n    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.\n    If n is greater than m, return -1.\n    Example:\n    rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n    rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        avg = round((n + m) / 2)\n        return bin(avg)\n```\n\nThis script first checks if `n` is greater than `m`.
