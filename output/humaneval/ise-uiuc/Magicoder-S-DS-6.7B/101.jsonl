{"task_id": "HumanEval/101", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    return s.replace(\",\", \"\").split()\n```\n\nThis script works by first replacing all commas in the string with nothing (effectively removing them), and then splitting the string into words using the built-in `split()` function. The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. By default, `split()` splits a string at spaces.\n\nFor example, if you call `words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\")`, it will return `[\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your task is\n    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.\n    \n    For example:\n    words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\n    words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    return s.replace(\",\", \"\").split()\n```\n\nThis script works by first replacing all commas in the string with nothing (effectively removing them), and then splitting the string into words using the built-in `split()` function.
