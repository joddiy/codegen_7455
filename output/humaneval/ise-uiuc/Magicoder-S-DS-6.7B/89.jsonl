If the character is a letter, it calculates the new character by shifting the ASCII value of the character by 2 places down. If the character is not a letter, it just adds the character to the result string as is.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(encrypt('hi'))  # returns 'lm'\nprint(encrypt('asdfghjkl'))  # returns 'ewhjklnop'\nprint(encrypt('gf'))  # returns 'kj'\nprint(encrypt('et'))  # returns 'ix'\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
