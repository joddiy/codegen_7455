{"task_id": "HumanEval/56", "completion": "Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str):\r\n    stack = []\r\n    for b in brackets:\r\n        if b == \"<\":\r\n            stack.append(b)\r\n        elif b == \">\":\r\n            if not stack:\r\n                return False\r\n            stack.pop()\r\n    return len(stack) == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets we encounter. If we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means we have too many closing brackets, so we return False. If the stack is not empty, we pop the top element and continue checking the next bracket. If we reach the end of the string, we return True if the stack is empty, indicating that all opening brackets have been matched by closing brackets. Otherwise, we return False, indicating that there are still opening brackets that haven't been matched. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
