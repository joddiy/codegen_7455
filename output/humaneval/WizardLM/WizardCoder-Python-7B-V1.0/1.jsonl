If the character is an open parenthesis, we increment the open count. If it's a close parenthesis, we decrement the open count. If the open count reaches zero, we have found the end of a group, so we add the current group to the list of groups and reset it. We also add any non-parenthesis characters to the current group. Finally, we add the last group to the list of groups and return it. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
