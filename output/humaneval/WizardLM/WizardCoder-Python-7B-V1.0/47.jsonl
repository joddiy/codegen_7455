{"task_id": "HumanEval/47", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef median(l: list):\r\n    \"\"\"Return median of elements in the list l.\"\"\"\r\n    n = len(l)\r\n    sorted_list = sorted(l)\r\n    if n % 2 == 0:\r\n        # if the list has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle values\r\n        return (sorted_list[n//2 - 1] + sorted_list[n//2]) / 2\r\n    else:\r\n        # if the list has an odd number of elements, return the middle value\r\n        return sorted_list[n//2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe median of a list of numbers is the middle value if the list has an odd number of elements, and the average of the two middle values if the list has an even number of elements. We can sort the list and then use integer division to find the middle index. If the list has an odd number of elements, the middle index is `n//2`. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle indices, which are `n//2 - 1` and `n//2`. We can use the `sorted()` function to sort the list in ascending order, and then return the appropriate value based on whether the list has an odd or even number of elements.
