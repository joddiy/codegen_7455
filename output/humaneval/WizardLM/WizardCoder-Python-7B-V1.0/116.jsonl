{"task_id": "HumanEval/116", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sort_array(arr):\r\n    # Convert each element to binary and count the number of ones\r\n    binary_count = [(bin(x)[2:].count('1'), x) for x in arr]\r\n    # Sort the array based on the number of ones and then decimal value\r\n    binary_count.sort()\r\n    # Extract the original values from the sorted binary count list\r\n    return [x[1] for x in binary_count]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function `sort_array` takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array based on the number of ones in their binary representation. We first convert each element to binary using the built-in `bin` function, which returns a string starting with the prefix `0b`, and then count the number of ones using the `count` method. We create a list of tuples containing the count of ones and the original value. We then sort this list based on the first element of each tuple, which is the count of ones, and then the second element, which is the original value. Finally, we extract the original values from the sorted list and return it. If two elements have the same count of ones, they are sorted based on their decimal value.
