It works by iterating over all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and checking if any of them divide `n` without a remainder. If none of them do, then `n` is prime.\r\n\r\nThe `words_in_sentence` function takes a sentence as input and splits it into words using the `split` method. It then iterates over the words and checks if the length of each word is prime using the `is_prime` function. If the length is prime, it adds the word to the `result` list. Finally, it joins the words in the `result` list with a space and returns the result.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert words_in_sentence(\"This is a test\") == \"is\"\r\nassert words_in_sentence(\"lets go for swimming\") == \"go for\"\r\nassert words_in_sentence(\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\") == \"quick over\"\r\nassert words_in_sentence(\"hello world\") == \"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last test case returns an empty string because there are no words with prime length in the sentence.
