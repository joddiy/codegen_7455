This will give us the k maximum numbers in the array. Since we are sorting in descending order, the first k elements will be the maximum numbers in the array. We can use the `sort()` method of the list to sort the array in descending order. We can then iterate through the sorted array and add the first k elements to a new list, which will contain the k maximum numbers. Finally, we return this list.
