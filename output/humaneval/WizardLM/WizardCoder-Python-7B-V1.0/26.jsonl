{"task_id": "HumanEval/26", "completion": "One possible solution to this problem is to use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the input list, and then return only the elements that have a count of 1. Here's the code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import List\r\n\r\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\r\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\r\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\r\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\r\n    [1, 3, 4]\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    counts = {}\r\n    for num in numbers:\r\n        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1\r\n    return [num for num in numbers if counts[num] == 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution works by iterating over each element in the input list, and keeping track of its count in a dictionary. If the element is not already in the dictionary, it is initialized to 1. If it is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented. Finally, a list comprehension is used to return only the elements that have a count of 1. This works because the dictionary keys are unique, so only the elements that occur once will have a count of 1. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
