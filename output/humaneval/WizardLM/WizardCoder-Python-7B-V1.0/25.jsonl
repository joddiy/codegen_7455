We start with the smallest prime number `2` and keep dividing `n` by `i` until it is no longer divisible by `i`. At each step, we append `i` to the list of factors and update `n` accordingly. If `n` is still greater than `1` after the loop, we append the remaining factor `n` to the list of factors. Finally, we return the list of factors. Note that this solution assumes that the input number is positive and greater than `1`. If you want to handle negative numbers or zero, you can add some additional checks to the function.
