We repeat this process until `x` becomes 0. We concatenate the remainders in reverse order to get the string representation of the number in the new base. For example, if `x` is `8` and `base` is `3`, we first get `0` as the remainder and then `2` as the remainder of `x // 3`. We concatenate these two values to get `'2'` and then keep dividing `x` by `3` until it becomes `0`. Similarly, if `x` is `7` and `base` is `2`, we get `1` as the remainder and then `1` as the remainder of `x // 2`. We concatenate these two values to get `'11'` and then keep dividing `x` by `2` until it becomes `0`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
