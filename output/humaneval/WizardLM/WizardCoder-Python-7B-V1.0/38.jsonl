For example, if the input string is \"abcdefg\", the output string would be \"bdfhcag\". This is achieved by first splitting the input string into groups of three characters, then cycling the elements in each group. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left as is.\r\n\r\nThe `decode_cyclic` function takes a string as input that has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function and returns the original string. This is achieved by reversing the cycling operation performed in `encode_cyclic`. For each group of three characters, the first character is moved to the end and the rest of the characters are left in their original order. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left as is. The `min` function is used to ensure that the last group is not truncated. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
