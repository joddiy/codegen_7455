{"task_id": "HumanEval/146", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef specialFilter(nums):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for num in nums:\r\n        if num > 10 and (int(str(num)[0]) % 2 == 1) and (int(str(num)[-1]) % 2 == 1):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of elements in the array that satisfy the condition. We then loop through each element in the array `nums`. For each element `num`, we check if it is greater than 10 and if the first and last digits of the number are odd. We use the `int()` function to convert the number to a string and then extract the first and last digits using indexing. We check if the first and last digits are odd by checking if the remainder of the division of the first and last digit by 2 is 1. If both conditions are satisfied, we increment the `count` variable by 1. Finally, we return the value of `count`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
