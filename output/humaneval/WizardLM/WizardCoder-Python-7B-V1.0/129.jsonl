Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n\n    Examples:\n\n        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n        Output: [1, 2, 1]\n\n        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n        Output: [1]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef minPath(grid, k):\r\n    n = len(grid)\r\n    # Initialize a set of visited cells and a set of paths\r\n    visited = set()\r\n    paths = set()\r\n    # Initialize the queue with the starting cell (0, 0) and the empty path\r\n    queue = [(0, 0, [grid[0][0]])]\r\n    # Loop until the queue is empty\r\n    while queue:\r\n        # Get the next cell to visit\r\n        i, j, path = queue.pop(0)\r\n        # If the path length is equal to k, add it to the set of paths\r\n        if len(path) == k:\r\n            paths.add(tuple(path))\r\n            continue\r\n        # If the cell is out of bounds, skip it\r\n        if i < 0 or i >= n or j < 0 or j >= n:\r\n            continue\r\n        # If the cell has already been visited, skip it\r\n        if (i, j) in visited:\r\n            continue\r\n        # Mark the cell as visited\r\n        visited.add((i, j))\r\n        # Add the cell to the path\r\n        path.append(grid[i][j])\r\n        # Add the neighbors to the queue\r\n        queue.append((i-1, j, path)\r\n                    if i > 0 else None)\r\n        queue.append((i+1, j, path)\r\n                    if i < n-1 else None)\r\n        queue.append((i, j-1, path)\r\n                    if j > 0 else None)\r\n        queue.append((i, j+1, path)\r\n                    if j < n-1 else None)\r\n    # Find the minimum path\r\n    min_path = min(paths, key=lambda x: x[k-1])\r\n    # Return the list of values on the cells that the minimum path goes through\r\n    return list(min_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible paths of length k from the starting cell.
