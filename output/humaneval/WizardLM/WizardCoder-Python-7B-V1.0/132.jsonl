{"task_id": "HumanEval/132", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_nested(string):\r\n    stack = []\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        if char == '[':\r\n            stack.append(char)\r\n        elif char == ']':\r\n            if not stack:\r\n                return False\r\n            stack.pop()\r\n    return len(stack) == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets we encounter. If we encounter a closing bracket, we check if there are any opening brackets in the stack. If there are, we pop the top one and continue. If there are none, it means we have encountered a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so we return False. If we reach the end of the string and there are still opening brackets in the stack, it means there is a nested sequence, so we return True. Otherwise, we return False.
