We first check if the list is balanced by comparing the sum of the list to the sum of its reverse. If they are not equal, then the list is not balanced and we return `False`. If the list is balanced, we check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. If it is, we return `True`, otherwise, we return `False`.
