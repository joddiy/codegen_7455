{"task_id": "HumanEval/157", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, return True if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\r\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the third side\r\n    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2 or a**2 + c**2 == b**2 or b**2 + c**2 == a**2 or b**2 + a**2 == c**2 or c**2 + a**2 == b**2 or c**2 + b**2 == a**2:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if a triangle is a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the lengths of any two sides is equal to the square of the length of the third side. We can use this theorem to check if any two sides add up to the third side. If they do, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle. We can use this logic to check if the given sides form a right-angled triangle or not. If the sum of the squares of any two sides is equal to the square of the third side, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle. If not, then it is not a right-angled triangle.
