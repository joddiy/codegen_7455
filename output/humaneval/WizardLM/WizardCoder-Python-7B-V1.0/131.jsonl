{"task_id": "HumanEval/131", "completion": "Here's one possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef digits(n):\r\n    product = 1\r\n    for digit in str(n):\r\n        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:\r\n            product *= int(digit)\r\n    return product if product != 0 else 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of the odd digits. We then loop through each digit in the string representation of `n` using the `str()` function to convert it to a string. If the digit is odd (i.e. its remainder when divided by 2 is 1), we multiply it by `product`. If we encounter an even digit, we simply move on to the next one. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any odd digits, we return 0. Otherwise, we return the final value of `product`. Note that we use the ternary operator `product if product != 0 else 0` to return 0 if `product` is 0, since that means all the digits were even.
