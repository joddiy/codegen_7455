We also initialize `current_sum` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the sum of the current sub-array we are considering. We iterate over the array `nums` using a for loop, adding each element to `current_sum` and updating `min_sum` if `current_sum` is smaller than `min_sum`. If `current_sum` becomes negative, we reset it to 0, since we don't want to consider any sub-array that includes negative numbers. Finally, we return `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is still infinity, it means that all the elements of `nums` are positive, so we return 0. Otherwise, we return `min_sum`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `nums` is `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`, we start with `min_sum = infinity` and `current_sum = 0`. We add `2` to `current_sum`, which becomes `2`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. Then we add `3` to `current_sum`, which becomes `5`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. We add `4` to `current_sum`, which becomes `6`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. We add `1` to `current_sum`, which becomes `7`. We add `2` to `current_sum`, which becomes `9`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. We add `4` to `current_sum`, which becomes `13`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. We add `4` to `current_sum`, which becomes `17`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. We add `2` to `current_sum`, which becomes `19`. We add `4` to `current_sum`, which becomes `23`. We update `min_sum` to `2`. We return `min_sum`, which is `2`.\r\n\r\nIf `nums` is `[-1, -2, -3]`, we start with `min_sum = infinity` and `current_sum = 0`. We add `-1` to `current_sum`, which becomes `-1`. We update `min_sum` to `-1`. We add `-2` to `current_sum`, which becomes `-3`. We update `min_sum` to `-3`. We add `-3` to `current_sum`, which becomes `-6`.
