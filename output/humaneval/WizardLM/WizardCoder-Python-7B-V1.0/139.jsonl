The special factorial is calculated by multiplying all the integers from `n` down to 1. For example, if `n` is 4, then the special factorial is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. We can use recursion to calculate the special factorial. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, we return 1 as the base case. Otherwise, we multiply `n` with the special factorial of `n-1` and keep doing this until we reach 1. The final result is the product of all the integers from `n` down to 1.
