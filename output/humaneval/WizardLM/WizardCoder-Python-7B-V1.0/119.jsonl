{"task_id": "HumanEval/119", "completion": "Here's one possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef match_parens(lst):\r\n    # Initialize a stack to keep track of open parentheses\r\n    stack = []\r\n    \r\n    # Iterate through each character in the list\r\n    for char in lst:\r\n        # If the character is an open parenthesis, push it onto the stack\r\n        if char == '(':\r\n            stack.append(char)\r\n        # If the character is a close parenthesis, check if there is a matching open parenthesis\r\n        # on the stack.

Return 'Yes'\r\n    return 'Yes' if not stack else 'No'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution uses a stack to keep track of open parentheses. Whenever we encounter an open parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. Whenever we encounter a close parenthesis, we check if there is a matching open parenthesis on the stack. If there is, we pop it. If there isn't, we return 'No'. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, we know that all parentheses are matched, so we return 'Yes'. Otherwise, we return 'No'.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(match_parens(['()(', ')'])) # Yes\r\nprint(match_parens([')', ')'])) # No\r\nprint(match_parens(['()'])) # Yes\r\nprint(match_parens(['(', ')'])) # Yes\r\nprint(match_parens(['()', '(', ')'])) # No\r\nprint(match_parens(['(', ')', '(', ')'])) # No\r\nprint(match_parens(['(', ')', '(', ')', ')'])) # Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we can also use a list to keep track of open parentheses instead of a stack. We can append to the list when we encounter an open parenthesis and pop from it when we encounter a close parenthesis. However, using a stack is more efficient since we don't need to iterate through the list to find matching open parentheses. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string\n    '())' is not.\n    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'\n    '''\n```\n\n### Response:Here's one possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef match_parens(lst):\r\n    # Initialize a stack to keep track of open parentheses\r\n    stack = []\r\n    \r\n    # Iterate through each character in the list\r\n    for char in lst:\r\n        # If the character is an open parenthesis, push it onto the stack\r\n        if char == '(':\r\n            stack.append(char)\r\n        # If the character is a close parenthesis, check if there is a matching open parenthesis\r\n        # on the stack.
