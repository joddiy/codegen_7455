If `a` is less than 100, it then checks if it is divisible by 2 or 5, since these are not prime numbers. If it is divisible by either of these, it returns False.\r\n\r\nNext, it checks if `a` is divisible by any prime number between 3 and 10. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False, since we know that the product of 3 prime numbers cannot be less than 100.\r\n\r\nIf `a` is not divisible by any prime number between 3 and 10, it then checks if it is the product of 3 prime numbers. It does this by iterating through all numbers between 2 and `a/2`, checking if `a` is divisible by each number. If it is divisible by any number, it increments a counter `count`. If `count` is still 0 after iterating through all numbers, it means that `a` is not the product of 3 prime numbers. If `count` is 0 after iterating through all numbers, it means that `a` is divisible by a prime number, so it continues to the next iteration.\r\n\r\nIf `count` is not 0 after iterating through all numbers, it means that `a` is divisible by a composite number, so it continues to the next iteration. If `count` is 0 after iterating through all numbers, it means that `a` is the product of 3 prime numbers, so it returns True.\r\n\r\nIf none of the above conditions are met, the function returns False.
