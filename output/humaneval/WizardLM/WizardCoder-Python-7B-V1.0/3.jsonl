Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and\n    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.\n    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])\n    False\n    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import List\r\n\r\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\r\n    balance = 0\r\n    for op in operations:\r\n        balance += op\r\n        if balance < 0:\r\n            return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution iterates through the list of operations and adds each operation to the current balance.
