We can do this by rotating b by one character at a time and checking if the rotated version is a substring of a. We can do this using a loop that iterates over the length of b and concatenates the first character of b with the last character of b, then the second character of b with the second-to-last character of b, and so on. We keep rotating until we reach the original b again.\r\n\r\nFor example, if b is \"abc\", we would rotate it to \"bca\", then \"cab\", then \"abc\" again. If any of these rotations is a substring of a, then we return True because it means that b is a cyclic pattern of a.\r\n\r\nIf none of the rotations of b are a substring of a, then we return False.
