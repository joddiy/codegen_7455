{"task_id": "HumanEval/67", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef fruit_distribution(s,n):\r\n    # Split the string into two parts using the word \"and\" as the delimiter\r\n    parts = s.split(\" and \")\r\n    # Convert the first part to an integer and store it in apples variable\r\n    apples = int(parts[0])\r\n    # Convert the second part to an integer and store it in oranges variable\r\n    oranges = int(parts[1].split()[0])\r\n    # Calculate the total number of fruits in the basket\r\n    total_fruits = apples + oranges\r\n    # Calculate the number of mango fruits by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the given number of fruits\r\n    mango_fruits = n - total_fruits\r\n    # Return the number of mango fruits\r\n    return mango_fruits\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe first split the string into two parts using the word \"and\" as the delimiter. Then we convert the first part to an integer and store it in the variable `apples` and the second part to an integer and store it in the variable `oranges`. We calculate the total number of fruits by adding the values of `apples` and `oranges`. Finally, we subtract the total number of fruits from the given number of fruits `n` to get the number of mango fruits and return it. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Given the string that represents the total number of \n    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits \n    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.\n    for examble:\n    fruit_distribution(\"5 apples and 6 oranges\", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8\n    fruit_distribution(\"0 apples and 1 oranges\",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2\n    fruit_distribution(\"2 apples and 3 oranges\", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95\n    fruit_distribution(\"100 apples and 1 oranges\",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef fruit_distribution(s,n):\r\n    # Split the string into two parts using the word \"and\" as the delimiter\r\n    parts = s.split(\" and \")\r\n    # Convert the first part to an integer and store it in apples variable\r\n    apples = int(parts[0])\r\n    # Convert the second part to an integer and store it in oranges variable\r\n    oranges = int(parts[1].split()[0])\r\n    # Calculate the total number of fruits in the basket\r\n    total_fruits = apples + oranges\r\n    # Calculate the number of mango fruits by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the given number of fruits\r\n    mango_fruits = n - total_fruits\r\n    # Return the number of mango fruits\r\n    return mango_fruits\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe first split the string into two parts using the word \"and\" as the delimiter.
