Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef simplify(x, n):\n    \"\"\"Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression\n    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False\n    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,\n    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.\n\n    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\n\n    simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") = True\n    simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\") = False\n    simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\") = False\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef simplify(x, n):\r\n    # Convert the input strings to fractions\r\n    x_frac = Fraction(x)\r\n    n_frac = Fraction(n)\r\n    # Multiply the fractions\r\n    product = x_frac * n_frac\r\n    # Check if the result is an integer\r\n    return product.denominator == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use the `Fraction` class from the `fractions` module to represent fractions.
