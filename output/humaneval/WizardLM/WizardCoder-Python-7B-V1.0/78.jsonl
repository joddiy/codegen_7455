It first defines a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime. Then, it iterates over each character in `num` and checks if it is one of the four prime digits (2, 3, 5, B, D). If it is, it checks if it is also a prime number in base 16 (hexadecimal) using the `is_prime` function. If it is, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert hex_key(\"AB\") == 1\r\nassert hex_key(\"1077E\") == 2\r\nassert hex_key(\"ABED1A33\") == 4\r\nassert hex_key(\"123456789ABCDEF0\") == 6\r\nassert hex_key(\"2020\") == 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we use the `int` function to convert the hexadecimal digits to decimal numbers before passing them to the `is_prime` function. This is because the `is_prime` function only works with integers. Also, we use the `range` function with `int(n**0.5)+1` as the upper limit, because any number `n` can be factored into two factors `i` and `n/i`, and the largest factor that `i` can be is the square root of `n`. Therefore, we only need to check up to `int(n**0.5)` to find all the factors of `n`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
