Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    \"\"\"You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between \n    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).\n    \n    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't\n    find any vowel met the above condition. \n\n    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.\n\n    Example:\n    get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\") ==> \"u\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\") ==> \"U\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"quick\") ==> \"\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"ab\") ==> \"\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's one possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\r\n    vowels = \"AEIOU\"\r\n    for i in range(len(word)-1, 0, -1):\r\n        if word[i].upper() in vowels and word[i-1].upper() not in vowels:\r\n            return word[i].upper()\r\n    return \"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a word as input and iterates through it from right to left, checking if each character is a vowel and if the character before it is a consonant.
