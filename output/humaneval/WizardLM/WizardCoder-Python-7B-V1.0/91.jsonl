Then, it loops through each sentence and checks if it starts with the word \"I\" using the `startswith()` method. If it does, it increments the counter for boredoms. Finally, it returns the total number of boredoms found. Note that we use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence before checking if it starts with \"I\".
