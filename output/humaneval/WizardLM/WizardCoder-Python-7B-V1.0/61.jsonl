{"task_id": "HumanEval/61", "completion": "Here's one possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\r\n    stack = []\r\n    for b in brackets:\r\n        if b == '(':\r\n            stack.append(b)\r\n        elif b == ')':\r\n            if not stack:\r\n                return False\r\n            stack.pop()\r\n    return not stack\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets we encounter. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means we have too many closing brackets, so we return False. If the stack is not empty, we pop the last opening bracket off the stack, since we have found a matching closing bracket. If we reach the end of the string and the stack is empty, we return True, since all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets. If we encounter any other character, we return False, since it is not a valid bracket.\r\n\r\nWe can also use a list to keep track of the opening brackets, and check if the length of the list is equal to zero at the end. This is equivalent to checking if the stack is empty. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
