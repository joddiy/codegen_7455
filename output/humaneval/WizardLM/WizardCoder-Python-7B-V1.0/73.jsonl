A palindromic array is an array that is the same when read forwards and backwards. We can achieve this by changing half of the elements to match the corresponding elements in the reversed array. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2], we can change the first and last elements to make it [2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]. If the array is already palindromic, we don't need to change any elements. If the array is already palindromic, we can return 0.\r\n\r\nWe can calculate the sum of the elements in the array and the sum of the elements in the reversed array. The absolute difference between the two will give us the number of elements that need to be changed. We can then divide this by 2 to get the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. We first calculate the sum of the elements in the array using the built-in `sum()` function.\r\n2. We calculate the sum of the elements in the reversed array using slicing with a step of -1.\r\n3. We calculate the absolute difference between the two sums.\r\n4. We divide the difference by 2 to get the minimum number of changes required.\r\n5. We return the result.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]) == 4\r\nassert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\r\nassert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\r\nassert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) == 3\r\nassert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == 3\r\nassert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we use integer division (`//`) to ensure that the result is an integer.
