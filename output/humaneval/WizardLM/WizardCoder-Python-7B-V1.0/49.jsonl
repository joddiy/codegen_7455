{"task_id": "HumanEval/49", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\r\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\"\"\"\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return 1\r\n    else:\r\n        return (2 ** n) % p\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe `modp` function takes two arguments `n` and `p`. If `n` is 0, then the function returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the value of 2^n and returns the result modulo `p`. The modulo operator `%` is used to calculate the remainder of the division of 2^n by `p`. This is because the result of 2^n can be very large and can't be stored in an integer variable. Therefore, we use the modulo operator to get the remainder of the division of 2^n by `p`. This ensures that the result is always within the range of `p`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `n` is 3 and `p` is 5, then the value of 2^n is 8, which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. Since 8 is greater than 5, we take the remainder of 8 divided by 5, which is 3. Similarly, if `n` is 1101 and `p` is 101, the value of 2^n is 1024, which is greater than 101, so we take the remainder of 1024 divided by 101, which is 42. If `n` is 0, the function returns 1.
