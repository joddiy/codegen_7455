{"task_id": "HumanEval/99", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef closest_integer(value):\r\n    # Convert the input string to a float\r\n    value = float(value)\r\n    # Check if the value is positive or negative\r\n    if value >= 0:\r\n        # If positive, round up to the nearest integer\r\n        return int(value + 0.5)\r\n    else:\r\n        # If negative, round down to the nearest integer\r\n        return int(value - 0.5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first convert the input string to a float using the `float()` function. Then, we check if the value is positive or negative using an if-else statement. If it's positive, we round up to the nearest integer using the `int()` function and add 0.5 to it. If it's negative, we round down to the nearest integer by subtracting 0.5 from it and then converting it to an integer using the `int()` function. This works because if the value is equidistant from two integers, adding or subtracting 0.5 will round it away from zero. For example, if the value is 14.5, adding 0.5 will make it 15.0, which is the closest integer to 14.5. If the value is -14.5, subtracting 0.5 will make it -14.0, which is the closest integer to -14.5. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef closest_integer(value):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant\n    from two integers, round it away from zero.\n\n    Examples\n    >>> closest_integer(\"10\")\n    10\n    >>> closest_integer(\"15.3\")\n    15\n\n    Note:\n    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant\n    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the\n    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer(\"14.5\") should\n    return 15 and closest_integer(\"-14.5\") should return -15.\n    '''\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef closest_integer(value):\r\n    # Convert the input string to a float\r\n    value = float(value)\r\n    # Check if the value is positive or negative\r\n    if value >= 0:\r\n        # If positive, round up to the nearest integer\r\n        return int(value + 0.5)\r\n    else:\r\n        # If negative, round down to the nearest integer\r\n        return int(value - 0.5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first convert the input string to a float using the `float()` function.
