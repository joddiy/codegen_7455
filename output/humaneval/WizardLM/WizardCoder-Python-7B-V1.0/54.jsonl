{"task_id": "HumanEval/54", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Convert both strings to sets of characters\r\n    set_s0 = set(s0)\r\n    set_s1 = set(s1)\r\n    \r\n    # Check if the two sets have the same length\r\n    if len(set_s0) != len(set_s1):\r\n        return False\r\n    \r\n    # Check if all characters in s0 are present in s1\r\n    for char in set_s0:\r\n        if char not in set_s1:\r\n            return False\r\n    \r\n    return True\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first convert both input strings to sets of characters using the `set()` function. This removes duplicates and allows us to compare the two sets easily. We then check if the length of the two sets is the same. If they are not the same, we know that there must be at least one character that is present in one string but not the other, so we can return `False` immediately.\r\n\r\nIf the lengths are the same, we iterate over each character in `set_s0` and check if it is present in `set_s1`. If any character is not present in `set_s1`, we can return `False` immediately. Otherwise, we know that all characters in `set_s0` are present in `set_s1`, so we return `True`.\r\n\r\nNote that this solution assumes that the input strings are case-insensitive. If we want to make it case-sensitive, we can convert both sets to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
