If the character is a letter, we convert it to lowercase to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.\r\n5. We find the index of the character in the alphabet using the `index()` method.\r\n6. We shift the index down by the rotation amount (2 * 2) to rotate the alphabet.\r\n7. We convert the index back to a character using the `alphabet` string and add it to the encrypted message.\r\n8. If the character is not a letter, we add it to the encrypted message as is.\r\n9. We return the encrypted message. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
