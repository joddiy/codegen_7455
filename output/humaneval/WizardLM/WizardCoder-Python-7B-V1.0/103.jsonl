If it is, we return -1. Otherwise, we compute the average of n and m by adding them and dividing by 2. We then use the `round()` function to round the result to the nearest integer. Finally, we convert the result to binary using the `bin()` function and return it. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    \"\"\"You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the\n    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). \n    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.\n    If n is greater than m, return -1.\n    Example:\n    rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n    rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\r\n    if n > m:\r\n        return -1\r\n    else:\r\n        avg = round((n + m) / 2)\r\n        return bin(avg)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first check if n is greater than m.
