If `n` is 1, it returns `[1]` as the Collatz sequence for 1 is `[1]`. Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `sequence` and enters a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. In each iteration, it checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it divides it by 2. If `n` is odd, it multiplies it by 3 and adds 1. It keeps appending the values of `n` to the `sequence` list until it reaches 1. Finally, it returns the sorted set of unique values in the `sequence` list. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list in increasing order. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
