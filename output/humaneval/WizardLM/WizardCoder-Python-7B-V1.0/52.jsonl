It then iterates through each number in the list `l` and checks if it is greater than or equal to `t`. If any number is greater than or equal to `t`, the function returns `False`. If all numbers are less than `t`, the function returns `True`. This works because the `return` statement is only executed if a number is found that is greater than or equal to `t`, so if no such number is found, the function will reach the end of the loop without returning anything and implicitly return `True`.
