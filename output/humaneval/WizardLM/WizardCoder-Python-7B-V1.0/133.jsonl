Then we loop through each element in the list `lst`. For each element, we round it to the upper int(Ceiling) using the `math.ceil()` function and square it. We add the squared number to the `total` variable. Finally, we return the total sum of squared numbers. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
