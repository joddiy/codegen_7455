{"task_id": "HumanEval/158", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_max(words):\r\n    max_word = \"\"\r\n    max_count = 0\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        count = len(set(word))\r\n        if count > max_count:\r\n            max_count = count\r\n            max_word = word\r\n        elif count == max_count and word < max_word:\r\n            max_word = word\r\n    return max_word\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe iterate through each word in the list and count the number of unique characters in it using the `set()` function. We keep track of the maximum count and the corresponding word that has the maximum count. If we find a word with a higher count than the current maximum count, we update the maximum count and the corresponding word. If the count is the same, we compare the words lexicographically and return the one that comes first. If there are multiple words with the same maximum count, we return the one that comes first in lexicographical order. If there are no words with unique characters, we return an empty string.
