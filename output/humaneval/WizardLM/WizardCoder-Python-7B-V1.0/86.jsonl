{"task_id": "HumanEval/86", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\r\n    words = s.split()\r\n    result = []\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        if word == '':\r\n            result.append('')\r\n        else:\r\n            result.append(''.join(sorted(word)))\r\n    return ' '.join(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first split the string into words using the `split()` method. We then iterate over each word and check if it is an empty string. If it is, we append an empty string to the result list. If it is not empty, we sort the characters of the word using the `sorted()` method and join them back together using the `join()` method. Finally, we join the sorted words with a space using the `join()` method and return the result. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\r\n    words = s.split()\r\n    result = []\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        if word == '':\r\n            result.append('')\r\n        else:\r\n            result.append(''.join(sorted(word)))\r\n    return ' '.join(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first split the string into words using the `split()` method.
