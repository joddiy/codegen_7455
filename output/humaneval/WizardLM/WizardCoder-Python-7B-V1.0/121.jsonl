{"task_id": "HumanEval/121", "completion": "Here's one possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef solution(lst):\r\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of odd elements in even positions\r\n    sum_of_odds = 0\r\n    \r\n    # Loop through each element in the list\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        # Check if the element is at an even position (i.e. i is even)\r\n        if i % 2 == 0:\r\n            # Check if the element is odd (i.e. not divisible by 2)\r\n            if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\r\n                # If both conditions are true, add the element to the sum\r\n                sum_of_odds += lst[i]\r\n    \r\n    # Return the final sum\r\n    return sum_of_odds\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution works by looping through each element in the list and checking if it is at an even position. If it is, it checks if the element is odd. If it is, it adds it to the sum of odd elements in even positions. Finally, it returns the sum of all the odd elements in even positions. If there are no odd elements in even positions, the sum will be 0. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
