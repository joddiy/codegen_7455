{"task_id": "HumanEval/36", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n):\r\n        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:\r\n            if '7' in str(i):\r\n                count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing a variable `count` to 0. We then loop through all the integers from 1 to `n-1` using a `for` loop. For each integer `i`, we check if it is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, we check if the string representation of `i` contains the digit 7 using the `in` keyword. If it does, we increment the `count` variable by 1. Finally, we return the value of `count`.\r\n\r\nNote that we use `n-1` in the `range` function because the loop will stop at `n-1`. This is because the range function is inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end, so we want to stop at `n-1` to include the number `n` in the loop.
