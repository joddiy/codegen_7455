It checks if the number is an integer and positive using the `isinstance()` function and the `%` operator to check if the number is odd. If the number is odd, it adds the square of the number to the `sum_of_squares` variable. Finally, it returns the `sum_of_squares` variable. If the list is empty, it returns 0 since there are no odd numbers to square. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
