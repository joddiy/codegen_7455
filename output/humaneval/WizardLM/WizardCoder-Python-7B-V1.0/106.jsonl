We then loop through the numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. For each number `i`, we check if it is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is even, we simply append it to the `result` list. If `i` is odd, we calculate its factorial using a nested `for` loop and append it to the `result` list. We start the inner loop from 1 to `i` and multiply all the numbers to get the factorial. Finally, we return the `result` list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
