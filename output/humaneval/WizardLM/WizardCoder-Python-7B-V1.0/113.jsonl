{"task_id": "HumanEval/113", "completion": "Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef odd_count(lst):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        count = 0\r\n        for digit in lst[i]:\r\n            if int(digit) % 2 != 0:\r\n                count += 1\r\n        result.append(\"the number of odd elements in the string \" + str(count) + \" of the input.\")\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe iterate over each string in the input list using a for loop. For each string, we initialize a count variable to 0 and iterate over each character in the string using another for loop. If the character is an odd digit, we increment the count variable. Finally, we append the count to the result list and return it. The count variable is converted to a string before appending to the result list.
