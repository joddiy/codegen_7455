{"task_id": "HumanEval/149", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\r\n    # Create a new list to store the filtered words\r\n    result = []\r\n    # Iterate through the input list\r\n    for word in lst:\r\n        # Check if the length of the word is even\r\n        if len(word) % 2 == 0:\r\n            # If it's even, add it to the result list\r\n            result.append(word)\r\n    # Sort the result list by length and then alphabetically\r\n    result.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution uses a list comprehension to filter out the words with odd lengths, and then sorts the resulting list by length and alphabetically. The `key` parameter of the `sort()` method is used to specify a custom sorting order, where the length of each word is the primary key and the word itself is the secondary key. This ensures that words with the same length are sorted alphabetically. The function returns the sorted list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\r\n    # Create a new list to store the filtered words\r\n    result = []\r\n    # Iterate through the input list\r\n    for word in lst:\r\n        # Check if the length of the word is even\r\n        if len(word) % 2 == 0:\r\n            # If it's even, add it to the result list\r\n            result.append(word)\r\n    # Sort the result list by length and then alphabetically\r\n    result.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution uses a list comprehension to filter out the words with odd lengths, and then sorts the resulting list by length and alphabetically.
