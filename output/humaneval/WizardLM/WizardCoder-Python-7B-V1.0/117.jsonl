It then loops through each word in the list and counts the number of consonants in the word by looping through each character and checking if it is not a vowel (using the `in` operator to check against a string of lowercase vowels). If the word has exactly `n` consonants, it is added to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list. Note that this solution assumes that the input string contains only letters and spaces, so it does not handle any other characters that might be present.
