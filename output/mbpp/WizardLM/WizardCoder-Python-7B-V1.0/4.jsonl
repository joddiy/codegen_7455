It then iterates through each word in the list of words and checks if the length of the word is greater than or equal to 4. If it is, it appends the word to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all the words that are at least 4 characters long. The `set()` function is used to remove any duplicates in the list. The assertion checks if the function returns the expected output for the given input string. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_char_long(string):\r\n    words = string.split()\r\n    result = []\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        if len(word) >= 4:\r\n            result.append(word)\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a string as input and splits it into words using the `split()` method.
