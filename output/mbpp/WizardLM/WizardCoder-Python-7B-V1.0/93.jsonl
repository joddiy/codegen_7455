{"task_id": "Mbpp/162", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function `sum_series(n)` that calculates the sum of the series:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_series(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(n//2+1):\r\n        sum += n - 2*i\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates through a range from 0 to `n//2+1` (inclusive) and adds `(n - 2*i)` to the `sum` variable for each value of `i`. The `//` operator is used to perform integer division, so that the loop only goes up to `n/2`. The final value of `sum` is returned as the output of the function.\r\n\r\nFor example, `sum_series(6)` would return `12`, since the sum of the series for 6 is `6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 12`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to calculate the sum (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2, for instance n + (n-2) + (n-4)... (until n-x =< 0). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_series(6) == 12\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function `sum_series(n)` that calculates the sum of the series:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_series(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(n//2+1):\r\n        sum += n - 2*i\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
