{"task_id": "Mbpp/292", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the quotient of two numbers rounded down to the nearest integer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find(a, b):\r\n    return a // b\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b` rounded down to the nearest integer. The `//` operator performs integer division, which returns the floor division of `a` by `b`, which means that the result is the largest integer that is less than or equal to the true division of `a` by `b`. For example, `10 // 3` returns `3` because `3` is the largest integer that is less than or equal to `10/3`, which is `3.3333333...`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the quotient of two numbers rounded down to the nearest integer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find(a, b):\r\n    return a // b\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b` rounded down to the nearest integer.
