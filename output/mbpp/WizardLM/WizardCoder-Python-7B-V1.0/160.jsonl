We then loop through all numbers from 1 to `n` and check if `n` is divisible by each number. If it is, we append that number to the `divisors` list. Finally, we return the sum of all the elements in the `divisors` list using the `sum()` function. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to return the sum of all divisors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_div(8)==7\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_div(n):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes a number n as input and returns the sum of all its divisors.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    divisors = []\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if n % i == 0:\r\n            divisors.append(i)\r\n    return sum(divisors)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first initialize an empty list called `divisors` to store all the divisors of the number `n`.
