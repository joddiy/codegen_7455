It works by shifting the bits of `n` to the right by 1 bit at a time until `n` becomes 0. At each step, it adds 1 to the count if the least significant bit is 1. The function returns the final count of set bits. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a Python function that counts the number of set bits in a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Set_Bits(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    while n:\r\n        count += n & 1\r\n        n >>= 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a bitwise operation to count the number of set bits in the given number `n`.
