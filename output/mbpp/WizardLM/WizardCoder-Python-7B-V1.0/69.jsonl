By doing this, we can isolate the element that appears only once to the beginning of the array. We then return this element.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the input array is [1,1,2,2,3], the function will swap the first two elements to get [1,2,2,3,1]. Then, we return the third element, which is the only element that appears once. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
