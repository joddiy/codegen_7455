{"task_id": "Mbpp/279", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the nth decagonal number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_num_decagonal(n):\r\n    return n * (n * n * (n - 1) // 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe nth decagonal number can be calculated using the formula: `n * (n * n - n + 1) // 2`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. We can use this formula to find the nth decagonal number by setting `n` to the input parameter `n`. The `//` operator is used to perform integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth decagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the nth decagonal number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_num_decagonal(n):\r\n    return n * (n * n * (n - 1) // 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe nth decagonal number can be calculated using the formula: `n * (n * n - n + 1) // 2`.
