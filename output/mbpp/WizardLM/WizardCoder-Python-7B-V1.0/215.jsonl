{"task_id": "Mbpp/441", "completion": "Here's the Python code to find the surface area of a cube of a given size:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef surfacearea_cube(size):\r\n    return 6 * size ** 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe surface area of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of each side by 2 and then squaring it. So, for a cube of size `n`, the surface area will be `6n^2`. The function `surfacearea_cube` takes in a parameter `size` and returns the surface area of the cube. We can test it using the assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return `True` if the function returns the correct value for the given input. If the function returns a different value, the assertion will fail and the test will fail. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the surface area of a cube of a given size.
