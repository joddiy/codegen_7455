{"task_id": "Mbpp/793", "completion": "Here's a possible implementation for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef last(arr, x):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Returns the last position of an element in a sorted array.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\r\n        if arr[i] == x:\r\n            return i\r\n    return -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments: the array `arr` and the element `x` to search for. It iterates through the array in reverse order from the end to the beginning, checking if each element is equal to `x`. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that element. If it reaches the beginning of the array without finding a match, it returns -1 to indicate that the element is not present.\r\n\r\nHere's how you can test the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert last([1,2,3],1) == 0\r\nassert last([4,5,6,7,7,7,8,9], 7) == 3\r\nassert last([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 10) == -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first assertion checks that the function returns the correct index for the first occurrence of the element in the array. The second assertion checks that the function returns the correct index for the last occurrence of the element in the array. The third assertion checks that the function returns -1 if the element is not present in the array. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
