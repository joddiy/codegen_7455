Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef frequency_lists(lst):\r\n    freq_dict = {}\r\n    for sublist in lst:\r\n        for item in sublist:\r\n            if item in freq_dict:\r\n                freq_dict[item] += 1\r\n            else:\r\n                freq_dict[item] = 1\r\n    return freq_dict\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each sublist, and then iterates through each item in the sublist.
