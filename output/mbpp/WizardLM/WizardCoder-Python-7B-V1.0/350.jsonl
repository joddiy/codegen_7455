{"task_id": "Mbpp/752", "completion": "Here's a Python function to find the nth Jacobsthal number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef jacobsthal_num(n):\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    elif n == 1:\r\n        return 1\r\n    else:\r\n        return jacobsthal_num(n-1) + jacobsthal_num(n-2) + 2*jacobsthal_num(n-3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses recursion to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 0 or 1 respectively. For all other values of n, it calculates the nth Jacobsthal number by adding the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-3)th Jacobsthal numbers and multiplying them by 2. This is because the nth Jacobsthal number is the sum of the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-3)th Jacobsthal numbers, multiplied by 2. The function can be called with any positive integer n to get the nth Jacobsthal number. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(jacobsthal_num(5)) # Output: 11\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return the 5th Jacobsthal number, which is 11.
