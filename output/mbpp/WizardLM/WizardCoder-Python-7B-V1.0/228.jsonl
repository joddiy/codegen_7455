We can test it with the assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert rectangle_area(10,20)==200\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will pass because the area of a rectangle with width 10 and height 20 is 200. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the area of a rectangle.
