It then loops through each bit position and compares the bits. If there is only one difference, the function returns `True`, else it returns `False`. The `zfill()` method is used to ensure that the binary strings are of length 8, which is the number of bits in an 8-bit byte. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
