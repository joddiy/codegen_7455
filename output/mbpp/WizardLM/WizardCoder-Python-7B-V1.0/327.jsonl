If we encounter a space and we are not inside a quotation, we add the current value to the list and reset it. Finally, we add the last value to the list and return it. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract values between quotation marks \" \" of the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_quotation('Cortex \"A53\" Based \"multi\" tasking \"Processor\"') == ['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a Python function that extracts values between quotation marks \" \" of the given string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef extract_quotation(string):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Extracts values between quotation marks \" \" of the given string.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the values between quotation marks\r\n    values = []\r\n    # Initialize a flag to keep track of whether we are inside a quotation or not\r\n    inside_quotation = False\r\n    # Initialize a variable to store the current value being extracted\r\n    current_value = \"\"\r\n    # Loop through each character in the string\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        # If we encounter a quotation mark, toggle the flag\r\n        if char == '\"':\r\n            inside_quotation = not inside_quotation\r\n        # If we are inside a quotation, add the character to the current value\r\n        elif inside_quotation:\r\n            current_value += char\r\n        # If we are not inside a quotation and encounter a space, add the current value to the list and reset it\r\n        elif char == \" \":\r\n            if current_value:\r\n                values.append(current_value)\r\n                current_value = \"\"\r\n    # Add the last value to the list\r\n    if current_value:\r\n        values.append(current_value)\r\n    # Return the list of values\r\n    return values\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function works by looping through each character in the string. If we encounter a quotation mark, we toggle a flag to indicate whether we are inside a quotation or not. If we are inside a quotation, we add the character to the current value. If we encounter a space and we are not inside a quotation, we add the current value to the list and reset it. Finally, we add the last value to the list and return it. "}
