{"task_id": "Mbpp/120", "completion": "Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_product_tuple(lst):\r\n    max_product = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\r\n            product = lst[i][0] * lst[j][0]\r\n            if abs(product) > abs(max_product):\r\n                max_product = product\r\n    return abs(max_product)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can solve this problem by iterating through the list of tuples and finding the maximum absolute product between any two numbers. We can do this by comparing the absolute values of the products of each pair of numbers in the tuples. We can use a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs of tuples and keep track of the maximum absolute product seen so far. We can then return the absolute value of this maximum product since we only care about the absolute value of the product. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==36\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_product_tuple(lst):\r\n    max_product = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\r\n            product = lst[i][0] * lst[j][0]\r\n            if abs(product) > abs(max_product):\r\n                max_product = product\r\n    return abs(max_product)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can solve this problem by iterating through the list of tuples and finding the maximum absolute product between any two numbers.
