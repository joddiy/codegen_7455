{"task_id": "Mbpp/471", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\r\n    result = 1\r\n    for num in arr:\r\n        result = (result * num) % n\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in an array `arr` and an integer `n` as input, and returns the product of the array elements modulo `n`. We initialize `result` to 1, and then multiply each element in the array by `result`. Since multiplication is associative, we can group the multiplication of all the elements together and take the modulo of the result at the end. This ensures that the final result is also a number between 0 and `n-1`. We then return the final result. \r\n\r\nFor example, if `arr = [100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14]` and `n = 11`, then the function will first calculate `(100 * 10 * 5 * 25 * 35 * 14) % 11 = 9`, which is the same as `(100 * 10 * 5 * 25 * 35) % 11 * 14 % 11 = 9`.
