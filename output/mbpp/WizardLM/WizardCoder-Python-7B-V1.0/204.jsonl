Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef and_tuples(t1, t2):\r\n    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `zip()` function is used to iterate over the two tuples simultaneously and the `&` operator is used to perform the elementwise AND operation on each pair of elements.
