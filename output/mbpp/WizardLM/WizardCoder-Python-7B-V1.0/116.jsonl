{"task_id": "Mbpp/240", "completion": "Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef replace_list(list1, list2):\r\n    list1[-1] = list2\r\n    return list1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two lists as arguments and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. It does this by using the slicing operator `list1[-1]` to access the last element of `list1`, which is a reference to the last element of the list, and then assigning it to `list2`, which replaces the last element with the entire second list. The function then returns the modified `list1`.\r\n\r\nHere's how you can test the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return `True` if the function works as expected. If you run the function with different inputs, you can test it with an assertion to ensure it works as expected. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert replace_list([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\r\nassert replace_list([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese assertions should both return `True`.
