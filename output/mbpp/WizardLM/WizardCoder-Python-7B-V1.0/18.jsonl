For example, the 5th octagonal number is `5 * (5 * 2 - 1) = 20`, so `is_octagonal(5)` would return `20`.\r\n\r\nWe can test this function by running `assert is_octagonal(5) == 65` in a Python interpreter or by adding a unit test to our code. Here's an example of how to add a unit test:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_is_octagonal():\r\n    assert is_octagonal(5) == 65\r\n    assert is_octagonal(10) == 165\r\n    assert is_octagonal(15) == 505\r\n    assert is_octagonal(20) == 1005\r\n    assert is_octagonal(25) == 2255\r\n    assert is_octagonal(30) == 3655\r\n    assert is_octagonal(35) == 5655\r\n    assert is_octagonal(40) == 7255\r\n    assert is_octagonal(45) == 9855\r\n    assert is_octagonal(50) == 12855\r\n    assert is_octagonal(55) == 16255\r\n    assert is_octagonal(60) == 20055\r\n    assert is_octagonal(65) == 24455\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test will run all the assertions and ensure that our function is working correctly. If any of the assertions fail, we'll get an error message that tells us which one failed. If all of them pass, we can be confident that our function is correct.
