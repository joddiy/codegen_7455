It initializes an empty set called `common` to store the common elements. It then loops through each element `num` in the first list `lst` and checks if it is present in all the other lists using a list comprehension and the `all` function. If it is, it adds it to the `common` set. Finally, it returns the set of common elements. Note that we use the `set` function to remove duplicates and preserve the order of the elements. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the common elements in given nested lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef common_in_nested_lists(lists):\r\n    common = set()\r\n    for lst in lists:\r\n        for num in lst:\r\n            if all(num in lst2 for lst2 in lists):\r\n                common.add(num)\r\n    return common\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe `common_in_nested_lists` function takes a list of lists as input and returns a set of common elements among all the lists.
