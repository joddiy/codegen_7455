It initializes a variable `min_length` to the length of the first list in the input list. Then, it compares the length of each list with `min_length` and updates `min_length` if the length of the current list is smaller than `min_length`. Finally, it returns `min_length` which is the length of the smallest list in the input list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Find_Min_Length(lst):\r\n    min_length = len(lst[0])\r\n    for i in lst:\r\n        if len(i) < min_length:\r\n            min_length = len(i)\r\n    return min_length\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each list in the list.
