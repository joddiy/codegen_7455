We first check if the length of the array is less than 2, in which case there is no bitonic subsequence and we return 0. Otherwise, we initialize two arrays `max_sum` and `max_ending_here` with the same length as `arr`. `max_sum` will store the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at each index, and `max_ending_here` will store the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at each index.\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing `max_sum[0]` and `max_sum[1]` to the first element of the array. We also initialize `max_ending_here[0]` and `max_ending_here[1]` to the first element of the array. We then loop through the array from index 2 to n-1, where n is the length of the array. For each index i, we update `max_ending_here[i]` by taking the maximum of the previous maximum sum ending at index i-1 and the current element of the array. We also update `max_sum[i]` by taking the maximum of the current maximum sum ending at index i-1 and the maximum sum ending at index i-2. This is because the maximum sum ending at index i can either be the maximum sum ending at index i-1 or the maximum sum ending at index i-2 plus the current element of the array.\r\n\r\nIf `max_ending_here[i]` is greater than `max_sum[i-1]`, then the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at index i is `max_ending_here[i]`.
