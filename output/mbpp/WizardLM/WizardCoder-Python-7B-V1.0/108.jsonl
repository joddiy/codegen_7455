Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a string and character, replaces blank spaces in the string with the character, and returns the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_blank(\"hello people\",'@')==(\"hello@people\")\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef replace_blank(string, character):\r\n    return string.replace(\" \", character)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a string and a character as arguments, and replaces all the blank spaces in the string with the given character.
