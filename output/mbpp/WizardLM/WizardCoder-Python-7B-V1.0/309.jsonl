", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Split(lst):\r\n    even_numbers = []\r\n    for num in lst:\r\n        if num % 2 == 0:\r\n            even_numbers.append(num)\r\n    return even_numbers\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n- We define a function called `Split` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.\r\n- We create an empty list called `even_numbers` to store the even numbers.\r\n- We loop through each number in the list using a `for` loop.\r\n- For each number, we check if it is even by using the modulo operator `%`.
