{"task_id": "Mbpp/141", "completion": "Here's a Python function that sorts a list of elements using the pancake sorting algorithm:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef pancake_sort(lst):\r\n    n = len(lst)\r\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\r\n        max_index = i\r\n        for j in range(0, i):\r\n            if lst[j] > lst[max_index]:\r\n                max_index = j\r\n        if max_index != i:\r\n            lst[max_index], lst[i] = lst[i], lst[max_index]\r\n            lst[0:max_index+1] = lst[max_index::-1]\r\n            lst[0:i+1] = lst[i::-1]\r\n    return lst\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes a list of elements as input and returns the sorted list. The algorithm works by finding the maximum element in the list and flipping it to the beginning of the list. Then, it flips the entire list from the maximum element to the beginning until it reaches the current index. This process is repeated for each element in the list until the list is sorted.\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. We start by initializing the length of the list as `n`.\r\n2. We loop through the list from the last element to the first element.\r\n3. We find the index of the maximum element in the list using a nested loop.\r\n4. We swap the maximum element with the current element if the maximum element is not already at the current index.\r\n5. We flip the list from the maximum element to the beginning until it reaches the current index.\r\n6. We repeat steps 3 and 4 for each element in the list.\r\n7. Finally, we return the sorted list.\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works with the input `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`:\r\n\r\n1. `n = 4`\r\n2. `i = 3`\r\n3. `max_index = 0` (since 79 is the maximum element)\r\n4. We flip the list from index 3 to 0, resulting in `[79, 25, 38, 15]`\r\n5. `i = 2`\r\n6. `max_index = 1` (since 38 is the maximum element)\r\n7. We flip the list from index 1 to 0, resulting in `[38, 79, 25, 15]`\r\n8. `i = 1`\r\n9. `max_index = 2` (since 69 is the maximum element)\r\n10. We flip the list from index 2 to 0, resulting in `[69, 38, 79, 15]`\r\n11. `i = 0`\r\n12. `max_index = 0` (since 15 is already at the beginning)\r\n13. We don't need to flip the list since it's already sorted.\r\n14. The sorted list is `[15, 25, 38, 69]`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the function returns `[15, 25, 38, 69, 79]` as expected.
