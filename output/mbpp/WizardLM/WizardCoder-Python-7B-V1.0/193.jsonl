{"task_id": "Mbpp/415", "completion": "Here's a possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_Product(arr):\r\n    max_product = arr[0] * arr[1]\r\n    min_product = arr[0]\r\n    max_pair = (arr[0], arr[1])\r\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\r\n        if arr[i] * max_product > max_product:\r\n            min_product = max_product\r\n            max_product = arr[i]\r\n        elif arr[i] * min_product < min_product:\r\n            min_product = arr[i]\r\n        else:\r\n            min_product = min(min_product, arr[i])\r\n        if max_product * min_product > max_product:\r\n            max_pair = (max_product, min_product)\r\n    return max_pair\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing the maximum product to be the product of the first two elements of the array, and the minimum product to be the first element of the array. We also initialize the maximum pair to be a tuple containing the first two elements of the array. We then iterate through the array, updating the maximum product and minimum product as we go along. At each iteration, we check if the product of the current element and the maximum product is greater than the current maximum product. If it is, we update the maximum product to be the current element. If it's not, we check if the product of the current element and the minimum product is less than the current minimum product. If it is, we update the minimum product to be the current element. If it's neither, we update the minimum product to be the minimum of the current element and the previous minimum product. Finally, we check if the product of the maximum product and the minimum product is greater than the current maximum product. If it is, we update the maximum pair to be the pair of the maximum product and minimum product. We return the maximum pair at the end. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
