{"task_id": "Mbpp/726", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef multiply_elements(t):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for i in range(len(t)-1):\r\n        result.append(t[i]*t[i+1])\r\n    return tuple(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a tuple `t` as input and iterates over it using a for loop. For each pair of adjacent elements in the tuple, it multiplies them together and appends the result to a new list `result`. Finally, it returns the tuple of `result`. The `range(len(t)-1)` argument ensures that the last element of the tuple is not included in the loop, since tuples are 0-indexed and the last element has index `len(t)-1`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef multiply_elements(t):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for i in range(len(t)-1):\r\n        result.append(t[i]*t[i+1])\r\n    return tuple(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a tuple `t` as input and iterates over it using a for loop.
