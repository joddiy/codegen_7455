{"task_id": "Mbpp/594", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef diff_even_odd(lst):\r\n    even_num = None\r\n    odd_num = None\r\n    for num in lst:\r\n        if num % 2 == 0:\r\n            if even_num is None:\r\n                even_num = num\r\n            else:\r\n                return num - even_num\r\n        else:\r\n            if odd_num is None:\r\n                odd_num = num\r\n            else:\r\n                return num - odd_num\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes a list as an input and initializes two variables `even_num` and `odd_num` to `None`. It then iterates through the list and checks if the current number is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if `even_num` is `None` and if so, it assigns the current number to `even_num`. If it is odd, it checks if `odd_num` is `None` and if so, it assigns the current number to `odd_num`. If both `even_num` and `odd_num` are not `None`, it returns the difference between them. If the list contains only even or only odd numbers, it will return `None`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef diff_even_odd(lst):\r\n    even_num = None\r\n    odd_num = None\r\n    for num in lst:\r\n        if num % 2 == 0:\r\n            if even_num is None:\r\n                even_num = num\r\n            else:\r\n                return num - even_num\r\n        else:\r\n            if odd_num is None:\r\n                odd_num = num\r\n            else:\r\n                return num - odd_num\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes a list as an input and initializes two variables `even_num` and `odd_num` to `None`.
