Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to filter odd numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert filter_oddnumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1,3,5,7,9]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef filter_oddnumbers(numbers):\r\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers.
