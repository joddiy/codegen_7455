It initializes the `max_length` variable to 0 and `max_element` to an empty list. It then compares the length of each list with the current `max_length` and updates `max_length` and `max_element` if the length of the current list is greater than `max_length`. Finally, it returns the `max_element`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the input list is `['A', 'B', ['A', 'B', 'C']]`, the function will return `['A', 'B', 'C'] as it is the longest list in the input list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the element of a list having maximum length:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Find_Max(lst):\r\n    max_length = 0\r\n    max_element = []\r\n    for i in lst:\r\n        if len(i) > max_length:\r\n            max_length = len(i)\r\n            max_element = i\r\n    return max_element\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each list to find the element with maximum length.
