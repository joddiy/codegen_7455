Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check if the elements of a given list are unique or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_unique([1,2,3]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef all_unique(lst):\r\n    return len(lst) == len(set(lst))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list as input and returns True if all the elements in the list are unique, and False otherwise.
