", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\r\n    if month_number in [4, 6, 9, 11]:\r\n        return True\r\n    elif month_number in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:\r\n        return False\r\n    elif month_number in [2]:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a month number as input and returns True if the month has 30 days, False otherwise.
