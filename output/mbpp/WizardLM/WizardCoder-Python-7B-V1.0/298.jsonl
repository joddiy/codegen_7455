Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef cummulative_sum(lst):\r\n    total = 0\r\n    for tup in lst:\r\n        for num in tup:\r\n            total += num\r\n    return total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of tuples as input and iterates through each tuple, adding up all the values in each tuple to a variable called `total`.
