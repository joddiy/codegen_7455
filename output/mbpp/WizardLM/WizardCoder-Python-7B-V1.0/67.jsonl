We use a try-except block to catch any `ValueError` that occurs when trying to convert a string to a float. If a `ValueError` occurs, we leave the element as it is. Otherwise, we append the float value to the subresult list. Finally, we convert the subresult list to a tuple and append it to the result list. We return the result list at the end.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to convert all possible convertible elements in a list of lists to floats. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert list_to_float( [(\"3\", \"4\"), (\"1\", \"26.45\"), (\"7.32\", \"8\"), (\"4\", \"8\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's one way to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef list_to_float(lst):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Converts all possible convertible elements in a list of lists to floats.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    result = []\r\n    for sublist in lst:\r\n        subresult = []\r\n        for item in sublist:\r\n            try:\r\n                subresult.append(float(item))\r\n            except ValueError:\r\n                subresult.append(item)\r\n        result.append(tuple(subresult))\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where all possible convertible elements have been converted to floats.
