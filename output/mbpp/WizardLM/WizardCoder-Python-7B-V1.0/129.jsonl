Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to maximize the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\n### Response:Here's one way to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef maximize_elements(tup1, tup2):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for i in range(len(tup1)):\r\n        if tup1[i][1] > tup2[i][1]:\r\n            result.append(tup1[i])\r\n        else:\r\n            result.append(tup2[i])\r\n    return tuple(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two tuples as input and compares their elements one by one.
