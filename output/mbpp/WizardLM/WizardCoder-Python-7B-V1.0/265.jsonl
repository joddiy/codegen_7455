{"task_id": "Mbpp/577", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes an integer n as input and returns the last digit of n! (factorial of n).\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Initialize a variable to store the result\r\n    result = 1\r\n    \r\n    # Iterate from n to 1 and multiply each number with the result\r\n    for i in range(n, 1, -1):\r\n        result *= i\r\n    \r\n    # Return the last digit of the result\r\n    return result % 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. We can find the last digit of the factorial of a number by taking the modulo of the product of all numbers from n to 1 with 10. The last digit of the factorial of a number is the same as the last digit of the product of all the numbers from n to 1. For example, if n is 4, then the last digit of the factorial of n is the same as the last digit of 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. We can use a loop to multiply all the numbers from n to 1 and then take the modulo of the result with 10 to get the last digit. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number.
