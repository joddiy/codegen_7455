{"task_id": "Mbpp/9", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Rotations(s):\r\n    n = len(s)\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    \r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if s[i] != s[i%n]:\r\n            return i+1\r\n    \r\n    return 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can solve this problem by finding the first character that doesn't match with its corresponding character after rotation. If all characters match, then we don't need any rotation. Otherwise, we need to rotate the string by the number of times until we get the same string. We can use the modulo operator to find the index of the first character that doesn't match with its corresponding character after rotation. The function returns the index + 1 as the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string. If the string is empty, we return 0 as there is no rotation required. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Rotations(s):\r\n    n = len(s)\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    \r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if s[i] != s[i%n]:\r\n            return i+1\r\n    \r\n    return 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can solve this problem by finding the first character that doesn't match with its corresponding character after rotation.
