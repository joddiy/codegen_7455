{"task_id": "Mbpp/287", "completion": "Here's the Python function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the sum of squares of first `n` even natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef square_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        sum += i**2\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and adds the square of each even number to the `sum` variable. The `range` function is used to generate the sequence of even numbers from 1 to `n`. The `**` operator is used to calculate the square of each number. Finally, the function returns the sum of squares of even numbers. \r\n\r\nTo test the function, we can call it with `n=2` and check if it returns `20`, which is the sum of squares of first two even numbers (2 and 4). If the function returns the correct value, the assertion will pass. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the sum of squares of first `n` even natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef square_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        sum += i**2\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and adds the square of each even number to the `sum` variable.
