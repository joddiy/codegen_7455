", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count true booleans in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count([True,False,True]) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_true_booleans(lst):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for item in lst:\r\n        if item == True:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list `lst` as input and initializes a counter variable `count` to 0.
