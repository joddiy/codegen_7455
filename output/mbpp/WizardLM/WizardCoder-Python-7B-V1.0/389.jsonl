Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_rotate(16,2) == 64\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function to rotate left bits by d bits:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef left_rotate(num, d):\r\n    return ((num << d) | (num >> (32 - d)) & 0xFFFFFFFF)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- The left shift operator `<<` shifts the bits of the number to the left by d positions, which effectively moves the bits to the left and fills the empty spaces with zeros.\r\n- The right shift operator `>>` shifts the bits of the number to the right by 32 - d positions, which effectively moves the bits to the right and fills the empty spaces with zeros.\r\n- The bitwise AND operator `&` is used to mask the result to ensure that only the first 32 bits are returned.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nnum = 16\r\nd = 2\r\n\r\n# left rotate num by d bits\r\nresult = left_rotate(num, d)\r\n\r\nprint(result) # Output: 64\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is 64 because 16 is left rotated by 2 bits, which is equivalent to shifting the bits to the left by 2 positions and then shifting them back to the right by 30 positions.
