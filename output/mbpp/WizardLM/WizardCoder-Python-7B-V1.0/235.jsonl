{"task_id": "Mbpp/468", "completion": "Here's the Python code to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence of an array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_product(arr):\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    elif n == 1:\r\n        return arr[0]\r\n    elif n == 2:\r\n        return max(arr[0], arr[1])\r\n    else:\r\n        max_product = arr[0]\r\n        min_product = arr[0]\r\n        result = arr[0]\r\n        for i in range(1, n):\r\n            if arr[i] > max_product:\r\n                max_product = arr[i]\r\n            elif arr[i] < min_product:\r\n                min_product = arr[i]\r\n            result = max(result * max_product, result * min_product)\r\n            if result < 0:\r\n                result = max(result * max_product, result * min_product)\r\n        return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing the variables `max_product` and `min_product` to the first element of the array, and `result` to the first element as well. We then iterate through the array starting from the second element. For each element, we compare it with `max_product` and `min_product`. If the element is greater than `max_product`, we update `max_product`. If it's less than `min_product`, we update `min_product`. We also update `result` to be the maximum of either `result * max_product` or `result * min_product`. If `result` becomes negative, we update it to be the maximum of `result * max_product` and `result * min_product`. At the end of the loop, `result` will contain the maximum product of an increasing subsequence of the array.\r\n\r\nWe return `result` as the final answer.
