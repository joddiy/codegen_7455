Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)] ) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to extract the number of unique tuples in a given list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef extract_freq(lst):\r\n    return len(set(lst))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list as input and returns the length of the set of the list.
