{"task_id": "Mbpp/56", "completion": "Here's the Python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check(num):\r\n    reverse = int(str(num)[::-1])\r\n    if num == reverse - 2:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first convert the given number to a string and then reverse it using slicing. Then we convert the reversed string back to an integer and subtract 2 from it. If the result is equal to the original number, then the number is one less than twice its reverse. Otherwise, it is not. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check(num):\r\n    reverse = int(str(num)[::-1])\r\n    if num == reverse - 2:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first convert the given number to a string and then reverse it using slicing.
