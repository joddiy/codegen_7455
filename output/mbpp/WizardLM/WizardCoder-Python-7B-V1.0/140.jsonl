{"task_id": "Mbpp/271", "completion": "Here's the Python function that solves the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef even_Power_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):\r\n        sum += i**5\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing a variable `sum` to 0. We then loop through the range of numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive) with a step of 2, which means we only consider even numbers. For each even number `i`, we add its fifth power to the `sum` variable. Finally, we return the `sum` variable. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that takes in an integer n and finds the sum of the first n even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that solves the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef even_Power_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):\r\n        sum += i**5\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing a variable `sum` to 0.
