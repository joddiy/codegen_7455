Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\r\n    for i in list1:\r\n        for j in list2:\r\n            if i == j:\r\n                return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function loops through each element in the first list and checks if it exists in the second list.
