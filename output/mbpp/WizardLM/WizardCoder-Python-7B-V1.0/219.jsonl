Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find cubes of individual elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef cube_nums(lst):\r\n    return [x**3 for x in lst]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list `lst` as input and returns a new list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in `lst`.
