", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)=={'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}\n```\n\n### Response:Here's one way to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef filter_dict(d, n):\r\n    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary with only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
