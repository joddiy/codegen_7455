For each element, it creates a new list with the current combination and adds it to the combinations list. Then, it loops through the remaining elements of the list and adds them to the current combination. After adding each element, it creates a new list with the current combination and adds it to the combinations list. Finally, it removes the last element from the current combination to continue the loop. This process is repeated until all possible combinations have been generated. The function returns the list of combinations. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
