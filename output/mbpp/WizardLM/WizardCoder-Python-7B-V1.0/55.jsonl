Since arrays are 0-indexed in Python, we need to subtract 1 from the value of `k` to get the actual index of the element we want to return. We then return the element at that index. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef kth_element(arr, k):\r\n    return arr[k-1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes in two arguments: `arr` is the array of elements and `k` is the position of the element to be returned.
