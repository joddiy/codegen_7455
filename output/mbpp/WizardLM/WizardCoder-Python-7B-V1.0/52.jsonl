{"task_id": "Mbpp/98", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math\r\n\r\ndef multiply_num(lst):\r\n    product = 1\r\n    for num in lst:\r\n        product *= num\r\n    return product / len(lst)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first initialize a variable `product` to 1, and then iterate over each number in the list `lst`. We multiply it with the current number in the list and update the `product` variable. Finally, we divide the `product` by the length of the list and return the result. The `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected value within a relative tolerance of 0.001. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math\r\n\r\ndef multiply_num(lst):\r\n    product = 1\r\n    for num in lst:\r\n        product *= num\r\n    return product / len(lst)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first initialize a variable `product` to 1, and then iterate over each number in the list `lst`.
