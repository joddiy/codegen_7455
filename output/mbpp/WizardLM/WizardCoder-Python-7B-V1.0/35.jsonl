The `//` operator is used to perform integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth tetrahedral number as an integer. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth tetrahedral number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a Python function that finds the nth tetrahedral number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\r\n    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses the formula for the nth tetrahedral number, which is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2`.
