{"task_id": "Mbpp/586", "completion": "Here's the Python function that splits a list at the nth element and adds the first part to the end:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\r\n    return arr[n:] + arr[:n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two arguments: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is the list to be split and `n` is the index at which the list is to be split. The function returns a new list that has the elements from the `n`th element to the end of the original list followed by the elements from the beginning of the original list up to the `n`th element. \r\n\r\nFor example, `split_Arr([12,10,5,6,52,36],2)` will return `[5,6,52,36,12,10]`. \r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1. The function first slices the original list `arr` from index `n` to the end using `arr[n:]`. This gives us the second half of the list.\r\n2. It then slices the original list from the beginning up to index `n` using `arr[:n]`. This gives us the first half of the list.\r\n3. It concatenates the two halves of the list using the `+` operator to form a new list.\r\n\r\nThe `+` operator concatenates two lists in Python. So, `arr[n:] + arr[:n]` gives us a new list that has the elements from the `n`th element to the end of the original list followed by the elements from the beginning of the original list up to the `n`th element.
