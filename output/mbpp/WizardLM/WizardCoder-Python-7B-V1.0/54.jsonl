{"task_id": "Mbpp/100", "completion": "Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\r\n    if n % 10 == 0:\r\n        return n + 1\r\n    \r\n    # Convert the integer to a string and reverse it\r\n    s = str(n)\r\n    s = s + s[::-1]\r\n    \r\n    # Increment the integer by 1 until it is a palindrome\r\n    while s != s[::-1]:\r\n        n += 1\r\n        s = str(n)\r\n        s = s + s[::-1]\r\n    \r\n    return int(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by checking if the input integer `n` is already a palindrome. If it is, we simply return `n+1`. Otherwise, we convert it to a string and reverse it to get the next palindrome. We then increment `n` until we find a palindrome by adding 1 to it and checking if the reversed string is the same as the original string. If it is not, we keep incrementing until we find a palindrome. Finally, we convert the palindrome back to an integer and return it. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer, returned as an integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\r\n    if n % 10 == 0:\r\n        return n + 1\r\n    \r\n    # Convert the integer to a string and reverse it\r\n    s = str(n)\r\n    s = s + s[::-1]\r\n    \r\n    # Increment the integer by 1 until it is a palindrome\r\n    while s != s[::-1]:\r\n        n += 1\r\n        s = str(n)\r\n        s = s + s[::-1]\r\n    \r\n    return int(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe start by checking if the input integer `n` is already a palindrome.
