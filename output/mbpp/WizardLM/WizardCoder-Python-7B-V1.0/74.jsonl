{"task_id": "Mbpp/126", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_common_divisors(num1, num2):\r\n    divisors = []\r\n    for i in range(1, min(num1, num2) + 1):\r\n        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:\r\n            divisors.append(i)\r\n    return sum(divisors)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two numbers as input and initializes an empty list called `divisors`. It then loops through all the numbers from 1 to the minimum of the two numbers plus 1. If a number is a divisor of both the input numbers, it is added to the `divisors` list. Finally, the sum of the `divisors` list is returned. \r\n\r\nFor example, if we call `sum_common_divisors(10, 15)`, the function will loop through the numbers 1 to 15 and find that 1 and 5 are the only common divisors of 10 and 15. The `divisors` list will be `[1, 5]`, and the sum of this list will be 6. Therefore, the function will return 6. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
