It uses a loop to reverse the array up to the position `k`. The loop runs from 0 to `k//2` because we only need to reverse the first half of the array. We swap the elements at the ith position and the (k-i-1)th position in the array. This is done because we want to reverse the array from the start of the array to the position `k`. The loop runs from 0 to `k//2` because we only need to swap the elements up to the midpoint of the array. Once the loop is done, we return the reversed array. The `assert` statement tests the function with the given input and ensures that it returns the expected output. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to reverse an array upto a given position. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes an array and a position k as input and returns the array with elements reversed up to k.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Reversing the array up to k\r\n    for i in range(k//2):\r\n        arr[i], arr[k-i-1] = arr[k-i-1], arr[i]\r\n    return arr\r\n\r\n# Testing the function\r\nassert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function `reverse_Array_Upto_K` takes an array `arr` and a position `k` as input.
