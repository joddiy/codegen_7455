The first row has 1 element, the second row has 2 elements, the third row has 3 elements, and so on. The pattern continues with each subsequent row having 2n-1 elements, where n is the row number. Therefore, the nth centered hexagonal number is n * (2n-1).\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. It takes an integer `n` as input.\r\n2. It returns the result of multiplying `n` with `(2 * n - 1)`.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function with the given assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should pass, since the 10th centered hexagonal number is 271.
