{"task_id": "Mbpp/611", "completion": "Here's a Python function that takes a matrix as a list of lists and an integer n as input and returns the max of the nth column:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\r\n    max_val = float('-inf')\r\n    for row in matrix:\r\n        if row[n] > max_val:\r\n            max_val = row[n]\r\n    return max_val\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function iterates through each row of the matrix and checks if the value at the nth index is greater than the current max_val. If it is, it updates the max_val. Finally, it returns the max_val. The function assumes that the matrix has at least one row and one column. If the matrix has less than n columns, it will return an index error. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a Python function that takes a matrix as a list of lists and an integer n as input and returns the max of the nth column:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\r\n    max_val = float('-inf')\r\n    for row in matrix:\r\n        if row[n] > max_val:\r\n            max_val = row[n]\r\n    return max_val\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function iterates through each row of the matrix and checks if the value at the nth index is greater than the current max_val.
