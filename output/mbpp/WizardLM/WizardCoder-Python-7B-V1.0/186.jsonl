Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Parity(num):\r\n    if num % 2 == 0:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes a number as input and checks if it is divisible by 2 or not.
