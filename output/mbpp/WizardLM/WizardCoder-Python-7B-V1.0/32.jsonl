Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find tuples which have all elements divisible by k from the given list of tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_tuples([(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], 6) == [(6, 24, 12)]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find tuples which have all elements divisible by k from the given list of tuples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_tuples(lst, k):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for tup in lst:\r\n        if all(x % k == 0 for x in tup):\r\n            result.append(tup)\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a list of tuples `lst` and an integer `k` as input.
