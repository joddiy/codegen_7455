It initializes a counter variable `count` to 0 and then iterates through each element in the tuple. If an element is equal to `x`, it increments the counter variable. Finally, it returns the count of occurrences of `x` in the tuple. In this case, the assertion passes because there are no occurrences of `4` in the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)`.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_X(tup, x):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for element in tup:\r\n        if element == x:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `x` as arguments.
