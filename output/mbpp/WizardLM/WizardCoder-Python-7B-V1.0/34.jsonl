The `%` operator is used to check if the length of the word is odd or not. If the length of the word is odd, the result of `len(word) % 2` will be `1` and the function will return `True`. If the length of the word is even, the result of `len(word) % 2` will be `0` and the function will return `False`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
