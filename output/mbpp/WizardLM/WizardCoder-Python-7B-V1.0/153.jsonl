If it does, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False. The `in` operator is used to check if the character 'a' is present in the string and the `*` operator is used to repeat the character 'b' twice or thrice. The `or` operator is used to check for both cases. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef text_match_two_three(string):\r\n    if 'a' in string and 'b'*2 in string or 'a' in string and 'b'*3 in string:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a string as an argument and checks if it contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters.
