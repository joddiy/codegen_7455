The function works by using binary search to find the correct position to insert `val` in the array. It starts with `left` and `right` indices at the beginning and end of the array, respectively, and iteratively narrows down the search space until it finds the correct position. The `mid` index is calculated as the average of `left` and `right`, and if the value at `mid` is less than `val`, the search continues in the right half of the array. Otherwise, the search continues in the left half. The function returns the `left` index when the search is complete, which is the correct position to insert `val` in the array.
