{"task_id": "Mbpp/422", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        sum += i**3\r\n    return sum/n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe initialize a variable `sum` to 0 and then use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n+1. In each iteration, we cube the current number and add it to the `sum` variable. Finally, we divide the `sum` by `n` to get the average of cubes of first n natural numbers. The function returns the result. \r\n\r\nWe can test the function by calling it with an argument of 2 and checking if it returns 4.5. If it returns 4.5, then the function is working correctly.
