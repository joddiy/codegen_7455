This works because the smallest number will be at index 0 and the second smallest number will be at index 1 after sorting. We can then use this function to test the assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return `True` since the second smallest number in the list is -2. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the second smallest number in a list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef second_smallest(lst):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    lst.sort()\r\n    return lst[1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use the `sort()` method to sort the list in ascending order and then return the second element of the sorted list, which will be the second smallest number.
