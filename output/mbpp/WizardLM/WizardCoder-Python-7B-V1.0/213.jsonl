It works by initializing a variable `result` to 0, then iterating over each integer in the list and adding it to `result` with a base of 10 (i.e. multiplying `result` by 10 and adding the current integer). This effectively concatenates the integers into a single integer. For example, if we have the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function would return `123`.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to join a list of multiple integers into a single integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef multiple_to_single(lst):\r\n    result = 0\r\n    for num in lst:\r\n        result = result * 10 + num\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of integers as input and returns a single integer that concatenates all the integers in the list.
