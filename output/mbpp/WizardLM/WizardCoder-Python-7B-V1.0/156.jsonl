Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_length(lst):\r\n    max_length = 0\r\n    max_lst = []\r\n    for sub_lst in lst:\r\n        if len(sub_lst) > max_length:\r\n            max_length = len(sub_lst)\r\n            max_lst = sub_lst\r\n    return max_length, max_lst\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and iterates over each sublist, keeping track of the maximum length seen so far and the corresponding sublist.
