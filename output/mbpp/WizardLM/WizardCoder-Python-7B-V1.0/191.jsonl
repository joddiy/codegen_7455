Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract the nth element from a given list of tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_nth_element([('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)] ,0)==['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function that extracts the nth element from a given list of tuples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef extract_nth_element(lst, n):\r\n    return [t[n] for t in lst]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments: `lst` is the list of tuples and `n` is the index of the element to extract.
