The `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the calculated volume is close to the expected value within a relative tolerance of 0.001. If the calculated volume is within this tolerance, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to calculate the volume of a cylinder:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math\r\n\r\ndef volume_cylinder(radius, height):\r\n    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height\r\n    return volume\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in the radius and height of a cylinder as arguments and calculates the volume using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.
