{"task_id": "Mbpp/803", "completion": "Here's the Python code to check whether a given number is a perfect square or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\r\n    if n < 0:\r\n        return False\r\n    else:\r\n        i = 0\r\n        while (i * i) <= n:\r\n            i += 1\r\n        return i * i == n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can check whether a number is a perfect square or not by checking whether the square of any integer is equal to the given number. If the square of any integer is less than or equal to the given number, then it is a perfect square. We can use a while loop to iterate through all the integers and check whether the square of any integer is equal to the given number. If the square of any integer is equal to the given number, then it is a perfect square. If the square of any integer is greater than the given number, then it is not a perfect square. If the given number is negative, then it is not a perfect square. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-given-number-is-perfect-square-in-cpp/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert not is_perfect_square(10)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to check whether a given number is a perfect square or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\r\n    if n < 0:\r\n        return False\r\n    else:\r\n        i = 0\r\n        while (i * i) <= n:\r\n            i += 1\r\n        return i * i == n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can check whether a number is a perfect square or not by checking whether the square of any integer is equal to the given number.
