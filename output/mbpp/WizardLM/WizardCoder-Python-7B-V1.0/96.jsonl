", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_even_pair([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_even_pair(lst):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\r\n            if (lst[i] ^ lst[j]) % 2 == 0:\r\n                count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs of integers in the list and checks if their xor is even.
