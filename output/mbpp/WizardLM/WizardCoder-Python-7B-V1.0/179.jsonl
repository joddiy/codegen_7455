We iterate through the string and update the count of each character in the dictionary. Then, we iterate through the string again and return the first character whose count is 1. If there is no such character, we return None. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the first non-repeated character in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_non_repeating_character(\"abcabc\") == None\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef first_non_repeating_character(s):\r\n    char_count = {}\r\n    for char in s:\r\n        if char in char_count:\r\n            char_count[char] += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            char_count[char] = 1\r\n    \r\n    for char in s:\r\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\r\n            return char\r\n    \r\n    return None\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first create a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the string.
