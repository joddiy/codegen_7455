Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_ludic(n):\r\n    lucid_numbers = []\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(i**0.5)+1)) and i % 1 != 0:\r\n            lucid_numbers.append(i)\r\n    return lucid_numbers\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We initialize an empty list `lucid_numbers` to store the lucid numbers.\r\n- We iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop.\r\n- For each number `i`, we check if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `i` (inclusive) using a generator expression and the `all()` function.\r\n- If `i` is not divisible by any number from 2 to its square root, we append it to the `lucid_numbers` list.\r\n- Finally, we return the `lucid_numbers` list.
