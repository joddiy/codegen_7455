{"task_id": "Mbpp/63", "completion": "Here's the Python code to find the maximum difference between available pairs in a tuple list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_difference(lst):\r\n    max_diff = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\r\n            diff = lst[j][0] - lst[i][1]\r\n            if diff > max_diff:\r\n                max_diff = diff\r\n    return max_diff\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n- We initialize a variable `max_diff` to 0 to keep track of the maximum difference found so far.\r\n- We loop through the list using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each element of the list, and the inner loop iterates through the remaining elements of the list.\r\n- For each pair of elements, we calculate the difference between their second and first elements and store it in the variable `diff`.\r\n- If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, we update `max_diff` to `diff`.\r\n- Finally, we return `max_diff`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)\r\n7\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the maximum difference between any two elements in the list is 7, which is between (3, 5) and (10, 3).
