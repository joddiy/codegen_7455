Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef remove_length(string, k):\r\n    words = string.split()\r\n    result = []\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        if len(word) != k:\r\n            result.append(word)\r\n    return ' '.join(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a string and an integer `k` as input, and returns a new string with all the words of length `k` removed.
