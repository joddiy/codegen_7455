{"task_id": "Mbpp/750", "completion": "Here's the Python code to add a tuple to a list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_tuple(lst, tup):\r\n    lst.extend(tup)\r\n    return lst\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two arguments, `lst` and `tup`. The `lst` argument is the list to which we want to add the tuple, and the `tup` argument is the tuple that we want to add to the list. We use the `extend()` method to add the elements of the tuple to the list. The `extend()` method adds all the elements of the tuple to the end of the list. Finally, we return the updated list. \r\n\r\nHere's how we can test the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis assertion checks if the function returns the expected output when we add a tuple to a list.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to add the given tuple to the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to add a tuple to a list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_tuple(lst, tup):\r\n    lst.extend(tup)\r\n    return lst\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two arguments, `lst` and `tup`.
