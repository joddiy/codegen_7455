If an item is a list, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count of lists found. The assertion passes because the input tuple contains two lists, so the function returns 2. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find number of lists present in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_lists(tup):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for item in tup:\r\n        if isinstance(item, list):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a tuple `tup` as input and iterates over its items.
