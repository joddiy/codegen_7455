We create a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We initialize the diagonal elements of the array to 1 because a single character is always a palindrome. Then, we iterate through the array and check if the current characters are equal. If they are, we add 2 to the length of the palindrome. If not, we take the maximum of the lengths of the substrings to the left and to the right of the current character. Finally, we return the value in the bottom-right corner of the array, which represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n^2)` and the space complexity is `O(n^2)`.
