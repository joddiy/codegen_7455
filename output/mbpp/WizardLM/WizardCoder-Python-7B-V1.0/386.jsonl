Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite function to find the sum of all items in the given dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the sum of all items in a dictionary:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef return_sum(d):\r\n    return sum(d.values())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a dictionary as an argument and returns the sum of all its values using the built-in `sum()` function.
