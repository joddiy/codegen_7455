", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of lists in a given number of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_list(lst):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in lst:\r\n        if type(i) == list:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a list of lists as an argument and iterates through each element of the list.
