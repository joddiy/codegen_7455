It does this by iterating over each element in the input list and adding it to a new list only if it hasn't already been added. The `two_unique_nums` function then calls `remove_duplicates` to remove duplicates from the input list and returns the first two elements of the new list if there are more than two elements. If there are less than two elements, it returns the original list. The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected output for the given input.
