Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to drop empty items from a given dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})=={'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a Python function that drops empty items from a given dictionary:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef drop_empty(d):\r\n    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v is not None}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `d`, and only keeps the ones where the value is not `None`.
