{"task_id": "Mbpp/109", "completion": "Here's a Python function that takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input and returns the number of odd digits in the rotated binary string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\r\n    # Convert the binary string to a list of integers\r\n    binary_list = list(map(int, binary_string))\r\n    \r\n    # Rotate the list by the given number of rotations\r\n    binary_list = binary_list[-rotations:] + binary_list[:-rotations]\r\n    \r\n    # Count the number of odd digits in the rotated list\r\n    odd_count = sum(1 for digit in binary_list if digit % 2 == 1)\r\n    \r\n    return odd_count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function first converts the binary string to a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. It then rotates the list by shifting the elements to the right by the given number of rotations using slicing. Finally, it counts the number of odd digits in the rotated list using the `sum()` function and a generator expression with a conditional expression. The `if` statement checks if each digit is odd by checking if it's divisible by 2 with a remainder of 1 using the modulo operator `%`. If the digit is odd, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0. The `sum()` function adds up all the 1's returned by the generator expression to give the total number of odd digits. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a Python function that takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input and returns the number of odd digits in the rotated binary string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\r\n    # Convert the binary string to a list of integers\r\n    binary_list = list(map(int, binary_string))\r\n    \r\n    # Rotate the list by the given number of rotations\r\n    binary_list = binary_list[-rotations:] + binary_list[:-rotations]\r\n    \r\n    # Count the number of odd digits in the rotated list\r\n    odd_count = sum(1 for digit in binary_list if digit % 2 == 1)\r\n    \r\n    return odd_count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function first converts the binary string to a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function.
