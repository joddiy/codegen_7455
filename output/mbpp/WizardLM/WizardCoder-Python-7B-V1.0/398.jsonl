", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check_smaller(tup1, tup2):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes two tuples as input and returns True if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, otherwise False.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    for i in range(len(tup1)):\r\n        if tup1[i] < tup2[i]:\r\n            return False\r\n    return True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function iterates through each element of the first tuple and checks if it is smaller than its corresponding element in the second tuple.
