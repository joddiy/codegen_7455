{"task_id": "Mbpp/58", "completion": "Here's the Python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef opposite_Signs(a, b):\r\n    if a*b < 0:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input. If the product of `a` and `b` is less than zero, then they have opposite signs. Otherwise, they have the same sign. Therefore, we return `True` if they have opposite signs and `False` otherwise. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef opposite_Signs(a, b):\r\n    if a*b < 0:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
