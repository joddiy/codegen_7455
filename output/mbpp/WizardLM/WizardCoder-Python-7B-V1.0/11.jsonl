We can test this function with the given assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert square_perimeter(10)==40\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the function returns the correct value, the assertion will pass. If not, the assertion will fail and the test will fail. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that returns the perimeter of a square given its side length as input. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_perimeter(10)==40\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function `square_perimeter` that takes a side length as input and returns the perimeter of a square:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef square_perimeter(side):\r\n    return 4 * side\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function simply multiplies the input `side` by 4 to get the perimeter of the square.
