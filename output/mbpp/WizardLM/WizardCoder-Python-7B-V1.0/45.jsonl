Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_substring([\"red\", \"black\", \"white\", \"green\", \"orange\"],\"ack\")==True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_substring(lst, substr):\r\n    for string in lst:\r\n        if substr in string:\r\n            return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two arguments: `lst` which is the list of string values and `substr` which is the string to be searched for.
