If it's not a tuple, it increments the count variable. Finally, it returns the count of non-tuple elements in the tuple. In the given example, the count will be 3 because there are 3 non-tuple elements in the tuple. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) ) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_first_elements(tup):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in tup:\r\n        if not isinstance(i, tuple):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function iterates through the tuple `tup` and checks if each element is a tuple or not.
