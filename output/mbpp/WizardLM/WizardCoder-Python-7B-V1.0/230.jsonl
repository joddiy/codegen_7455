Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to get the first element of each sublist. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Extract(lst):\r\n    return [sublst[0] for sublst in lst]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.
