{"task_id": "Mbpp/555", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef difference(n):\r\n    sum_of_cubes = sum([i**3 for i in range(1, n+1)])\r\n    sum_of_numbers = sum(range(1, n+1))\r\n    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. We use list comprehension to calculate the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The difference between the two is returned as the output. \r\n\r\nFor example, `difference(3)` returns `30` because the sum of cubes of the first three natural numbers is `1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 30` and the sum of the first three natural numbers is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Therefore, the difference is `30 - 6 = 24`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
