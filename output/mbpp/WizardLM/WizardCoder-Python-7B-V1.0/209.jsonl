{"task_id": "Mbpp/435", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the last digit of a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef last_Digit(num):\r\n    return num % 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a number as input and returns the last digit of the number. It works by using the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of the number when divided by 10. The last digit of a number is the remainder when divided by 10. For example, the last digit of 123 is 3, because 123 divided by 10 has a remainder of 3. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the last digit of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit(123) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the last digit of a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef last_Digit(num):\r\n    return num % 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a number as input and returns the last digit of the number.
