Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the length of the longest word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert len_log([\"python\",\"PHP\",\"bigdata\"]) == 7\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the length of the longest word in a list of words:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef len_log(words):\r\n    max_length = 0\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        if len(word) > max_length:\r\n            max_length = len(word)\r\n    return max_length\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function iterates through each word in the list of words and checks if its length is greater than the current maximum length.
