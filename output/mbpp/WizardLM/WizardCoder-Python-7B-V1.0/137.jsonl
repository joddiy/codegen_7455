It starts with the first two star numbers (1 and 2) and then iteratively calculates the next star number by adding the previous two. The loop continues until it reaches the nth star number, which is returned as the final value. Note that the function returns `None` if `n` is less than 1, since there is no star number for a negative or zero value of `n`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
