{"task_id": "Mbpp/229", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef re_arrange_array(arr, n):\r\n    neg = []\r\n    pos = []\r\n    for i in arr:\r\n        if i < 0:\r\n            neg.append(i)\r\n        else:\r\n            pos.append(i)\r\n    return neg + pos\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first create two empty lists, `neg` and `pos`, to store the negative and positive elements respectively. We then iterate through the given array `arr` and check if each element is negative or positive. If it is negative, we append it to the `neg` list, else we append it to the `pos` list. Finally, we concatenate the two lists and return the result. The result will be the re-arranged array with negative elements appearing first and positive elements appearing later, with their relative order preserved. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef re_arrange_array(arr, n):\r\n    neg = []\r\n    pos = []\r\n    for i in arr:\r\n        if i < 0:\r\n            neg.append(i)\r\n        else:\r\n            pos.append(i)\r\n    return neg + pos\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe first create two empty lists, `neg` and `pos`, to store the negative and positive elements respectively.
