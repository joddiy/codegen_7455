The `join()` method concatenates all the elements of an iterable object (in this case, the tuple) with a specified separator (in this case, an empty string). Since we don't have a separator, it simply joins the elements without any space in between. The resulting string is \"exercises\". ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to convert a tuple to a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tup_string(('e', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'i', 's', 'e', 's'))==(\"exercises\")\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to convert a tuple to a string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef tup_string(tup):\r\n    return ''.join(tup)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a tuple as an argument and returns a string by joining all the elements of the tuple using the `join()` method.
