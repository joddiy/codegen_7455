{"task_id": "Mbpp/781", "completion": "Here's the Python function to check whether the count of divisors is even or odd:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_divisors(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if n % i == 0:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    if count % 2 == 0:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if the count of divisors is even and `False` if the count of divisors is odd. It uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each number from 1 to `n`. If it is divisible, then it increments the count variable. Finally, it checks if the count is even or odd using the modulo operator `%` and returns `True` if it's even and `False` if it's odd. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
