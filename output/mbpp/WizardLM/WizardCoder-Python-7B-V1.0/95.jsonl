", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_char_position(string):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(string)):\r\n        if string[i].lower() == chr(i+97):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of characters that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet.\r\n- We loop through each character in the string using the `range()` function and `len()` function.\r\n- We convert the character to lowercase using the `lower()` method to make the comparison case-insensitive.\r\n- We check if the lowercase character is equal to the character at the same position in the English alphabet using the `chr()` function and the ASCII value of the character (97).\r\n- If it is, we increment the `count` variable by 1.\r\n- Finally, we return the `count` variable.
