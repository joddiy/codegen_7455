Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3) == True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_majority(arr, n, element):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if arr[i] == element:\r\n            count += 1\r\n        if count > n/2:\r\n            return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function iterates through the array and checks if the current element is equal to the given element. If it is, it increments the count. If the count becomes greater than n/2, it returns True, indicating that the element is the majority element. If the loop completes without finding a majority element, it returns False. "}
