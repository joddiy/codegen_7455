Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count number items that are identical in the same position of three given lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_samepair([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9],[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9])==3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\r\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes three lists as input and iterates over them using a for loop.
