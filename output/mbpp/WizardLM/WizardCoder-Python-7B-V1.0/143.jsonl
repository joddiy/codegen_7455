{"task_id": "Mbpp/274", "completion": "Here's the Python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(0, n+1):\r\n        sum += binomial_Coeff(n, i)\r\n    return sum\r\n\r\ndef binomial_Coeff(n, k):\r\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\r\n        return 1\r\n    else:\r\n        return binomial_Coeff(n-1, k-1) + binomial_Coeff(n-1, k)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n)` takes in a positive integer `n` and initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates through the range of `n+1` using a for loop and adds the result of `binomial_Coeff(n, i)` to the variable `sum` for each value of `i` in the range. The function `binomial_Coeff(n, k)` calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula `(n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)` where `!` represents factorial. The function returns 1 if `k` is 0 or `n` since the binomial coefficient for 0 and `n` is always 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the binomial coefficient by calling itself with `n-1` and `k-1` and `n-1` and `k` respectively and adds the result to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of all the binomial coefficients calculated. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
