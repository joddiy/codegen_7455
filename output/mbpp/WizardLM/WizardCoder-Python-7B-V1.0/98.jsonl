It initializes a variable `count` to 0 and then iterates through the list using a `for` loop. If the current element `i` is equal to `num`, it increments `count` by 1. Finally, it returns the value of `count`. This function will return 0 if `num` is not found in the list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef frequency(lst, num):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in lst:\r\n        if i == num:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a list `lst` and a number `num` as arguments.
