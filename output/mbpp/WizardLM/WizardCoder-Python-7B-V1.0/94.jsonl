We then iterate over the range from 1 to `a` and `b` and check if each number is a divisor of `a` and `b` respectively. If it is, we add it to the corresponding set. We then check if the sum of the two sets is equal, which means that the sum of the divisors of `a` and `b` are the same. If they are, we return `True`, otherwise we return `False`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> are_equivalent(36, 57)\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the divisors of 36 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18} and the divisors of 57 are {1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 23, 29, 57}, and their sum is 105, which is not equal to the sum of the divisors of 57, which is 1+2+3+7+14+29+57 = 87.
