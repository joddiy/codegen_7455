Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to get the frequency of all the elements in a list, returned as a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to get the frequency of all the elements in a list as a dictionary:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef freq_count(lst):\r\n    freq = {}\r\n    for i in lst:\r\n        if i in freq:\r\n            freq[i] += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            freq[i] = 1\r\n    return freq\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list as input and creates a dictionary where the keys are the elements in the list and the values are their frequency count.
