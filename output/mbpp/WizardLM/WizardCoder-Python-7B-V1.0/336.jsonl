{"task_id": "Mbpp/736", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef left_insertion(arr, val):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes in a sorted array and a value to be inserted and returns the index where the value should be inserted in the array.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\r\n        if arr[i] > val:\r\n            return i\r\n    return len(arr)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the value to be inserted. If it is, it returns the index of the current element. If the value is not found in the array, it returns the length of the array. This is because the value should be inserted at the end of the array. If the value is already present in the array, it will return the index of the first occurrence of the value. If the value is smaller than all the elements in the array, it will return 0. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
