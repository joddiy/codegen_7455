{"task_id": "Mbpp/125", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_length(binary_string):\r\n    max_diff = 0\r\n    count_0 = 0\r\n    count_1 = 0\r\n    for i in binary_string:\r\n        if i == '0':\r\n            count_0 += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            count_1 += 1\r\n        if count_0 > 0 and count_1 > 0:\r\n            max_diff = max(max_diff, count_0 + count_1)\r\n    return max_diff\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe iterate through the binary string and keep track of the count of 0s and 1s in two variables `count_0` and `count_1`. Whenever we encounter a 0, we increment the count of 0s and whenever we encounter a 1, we increment the count of 1s. We also keep track of the maximum difference between the counts of 0s and 1s seen so far in the variable `max_diff`. Whenever we encounter a 0 or a 1, we update `max_diff` if the difference between the counts is greater than the current value of `max_diff`. Finally, we return `max_diff` which will give us the maximum difference between the counts of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of the binary string.
