The area of a square is given by the formula `area = side ** 2`. Therefore, the lateral surface area of a cube is `6 * side ** 2`.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function using the assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis asserts that the function returns `100` when given a side length of `5`. If the function returns `100`, the assertion is successful. If the function returns a different value, the assertion will fail. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
