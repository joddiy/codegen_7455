{"task_id": "Mbpp/764", "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the number of digits in a given string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef number_ctr(string):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        if char.isdigit():\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a string as an input and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is a digit, it increments the count variable. Finally, it returns the count of digits found in the string. The `isdigit()` method is used to check if a character is a digit or not. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count number of digits in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to count the number of digits in a given string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef number_ctr(string):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        if char.isdigit():\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a string as an input and iterates through each character in the string.
