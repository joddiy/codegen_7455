We use the set() function to remove all the duplicates from the list and then check if the length of the set is equal to 1. If the length of the set is 1, it means that there is only one distinct element in the list, otherwise there are more than one distinct elements. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether a list of numbers contains only one distinct element or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert unique_Element([1,1,1]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that checks whether a list of numbers contains only one distinct element or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef unique_Element(lst):\r\n    return len(set(lst)) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list as input and returns True if the list contains only one distinct element, otherwise it returns False.
