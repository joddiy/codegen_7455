Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given number is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Even(1) == False\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to check whether the given number is even or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_Even(num):\r\n    if num % 2 == 0:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a number as input and returns True if it's even and False if it's odd.
