So, if the length of the original array is not equal to the length of the set of the array, it means that there are duplicates in the array. We can use this property to check if there are any duplicates in the array. If the length of the array is equal to the length of the set, it means there are no duplicates in the array. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert test_duplicate(([1,2,3,4,5]))==False\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\r\n    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe `set()` function in Python returns a new set with unique elements from the given iterable.
