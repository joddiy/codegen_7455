Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)])) == set([3, 4, 5, 7, 1])\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef extract_singly(lst):\r\n    flat_list = []\r\n    for sublist in lst:\r\n        for item in sublist:\r\n            flat_list.append(item)\r\n    return set(flat_list)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of lists as input and returns a set of all the numbers in the sublists.
