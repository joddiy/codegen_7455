{"task_id": "Mbpp/428", "completion": "Here's the Python code for shell sort:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef shell_sort(arr):\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    gap = n // 2\r\n    while gap > 0:\r\n        for i in range(gap, n):\r\n            temp = arr[i]\r\n            j = i\r\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\r\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\r\n                j -= gap\r\n            arr[j] = temp\r\n        gap //= 2\r\n    return arr\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nShell sort is a variation of insertion sort. It works by sorting elements far away from each other and then gradually reducing the gap between them. In this algorithm, we start with a large gap and move to smaller gaps until we reach the point where the gap is 1. This is similar to insertion sort, but it works better for large arrays.\r\n\r\nThe gap is initially set to half the length of the array, and we keep reducing it by a factor of 2 until it becomes 1. We then insert each element into its correct position in the sorted subarrays. We start with the largest gap and move towards smaller gaps until we reach the point where the gap is 1. We repeat this process until the array is sorted.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity of shell sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, but it is generally faster than insertion sort for large arrays. It is also less sensitive to initial order of the array elements. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to sort the given array by using shell sort. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for shell sort:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef shell_sort(arr):\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    gap = n // 2\r\n    while gap > 0:\r\n        for i in range(gap, n):\r\n            temp = arr[i]\r\n            j = i\r\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\r\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\r\n                j -= gap\r\n            arr[j] = temp\r\n        gap //= 2\r\n    return arr\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nShell sort is a variation of insertion sort.
