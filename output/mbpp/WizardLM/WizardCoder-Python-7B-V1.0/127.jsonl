{"task_id": "Mbpp/256", "completion": "Here's the Python function that counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, n):\r\n        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, i)):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We initialize a count variable to 0.\r\n- We loop through all numbers from 2 to n-1.\r\n- For each number i, we check if it is prime or not by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to i-1.\r\n- If it is not divisible by any number, we increment the count variable.\r\n- Finally, we return the count variable as the number of prime numbers less than n.\r\n\r\nThe function works by checking if a number is prime or not using the `all()` function and a list comprehension. The `all()` function returns True if all the elements in the iterable are true, and False if any of them are false. In this case, we use it to check if the number i is not divisible by any number from 2 to i-1. If it is not divisible by any number, we increment the count variable. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, n):\r\n        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, i)):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We initialize a count variable to 0.\r\n- We loop through all numbers from 2 to n-1.\r\n- For each number i, we check if it is prime or not by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to i-1.\r\n- If it is not divisible by any number, we increment the count variable.\r\n- Finally, we return the count variable as the number of prime numbers less than n.\r\n\r\nThe function works by checking if a number is prime or not using the `all()` function and a list comprehension.
