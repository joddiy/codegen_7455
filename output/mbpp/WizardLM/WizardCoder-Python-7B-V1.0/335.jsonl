{"task_id": "Mbpp/735", "completion": "Here's the Python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef toggle_middle_bits(num):\r\n    # Convert the number to binary and remove the first and last bits\r\n    binary_num = bin(num)[2:-1]\r\n    \r\n    # Toggle the bits in the middle\r\n    middle_bits = ''.join(str(int(not int(bit)) for bit in binary_num)\r\n    \r\n    # Convert the toggled bits back to decimal and add the first and last bits\r\n    result = int(binary_num[0] + middle_bits + binary_num[-1], 2)\r\n    \r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We first convert the number to binary using the `bin()` function and remove the first and last bits using slicing. The slicing `[2:-1]` removes the first two characters of the binary string, which are `0b` and the first bit.\r\n- We then toggle the bits in the middle using a list comprehension and the `int()` function. We convert each bit to its integer value, negate it using the `not` operator, and convert it back to a string.\r\n- Finally, we concatenate the first and last bits with the toggled bits and convert the result back to decimal using the `int()` function with a base of 2.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> toggle_middle_bits(9)\r\n15\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe binary representation of 9 is `1001`, so we remove the first and last bits to get `001`. We toggle the middle bits to get `010`, which is `2`. Adding the first and last bits, we get `1101`, which is 13 in decimal. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
