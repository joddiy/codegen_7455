If it is not found, we return the original string.\r\n- If the character is found, we use the `rfind()` method to find the index of the last occurrence of the character in the string.\r\n- If the first and last occurrence are the same, we return the substring from the start of the string up to the first occurrence and from the character after the last occurrence to the end of the string.\r\n- If the first and last occurrence are different, we return the substring from the start of the string up to the first occurrence, the substring from the character after the first occurrence to the last occurrence, and the substring from the character after the last occurrence to the end of the string.
