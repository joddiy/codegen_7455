We can use this method to find the position of the left most unset bit. We can then use the left shift operator `<<` to set the left most unset bit to 1. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to set the left most unset bit. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to set the left most unset bit:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\r\n    return n | (1 << (n.bit_length())\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent the binary representation of the given integer.
