For example, the 10th hexagonal number is 10 * (2*10 - 1) = 190. Therefore, the function `hexagonal_num(n)` returns the result of n * (2n-1). ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth hexagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert hexagonal_num(10) == 190\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the nth hexagonal number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef hexagonal_num(n):\r\n    return n * (2*n - 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe nth hexagonal number can be found by multiplying n with the formula 2n-1.
