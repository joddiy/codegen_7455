{"task_id": "Mbpp/734", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_of_subarray_prod(arr):\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    total_sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        for j in range(i, n):\r\n            product = 1\r\n            for k in range(i, j+1):\r\n                product *= arr[k]\r\n            total_sum += product\r\n    return total_sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe iterate over all possible subarrays of the given list using two nested loops. For each subarray, we calculate the product of its elements and add it to the total sum. The outer loop iterates over the starting index of the subarray, and the inner loop iterates over the ending index of the subarray. We use the `range` function to generate all possible pairs of starting and ending indices of subarrays. The `product` variable is initialized to 1 and updated with the product of the elements of the subarray in each iteration of the inner loop. Finally, we add the product to the total sum and return it. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
