Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef union_elements(tup1, tup2):\r\n    return sorted(set(tup1) | set(tup2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `set()` function is used to remove the duplicates from the tuples and then the `|` operator is used to find the union of the two sets.
