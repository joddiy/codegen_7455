It iterates through the expression character by character. If the character is an opening parenthesis or brace, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing parenthesis or brace, it is checked against the top of the stack. If the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening parenthesis or brace, it is popped off the stack. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, the expression is balanced. If there are any unmatched closing parentheses or braces, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
