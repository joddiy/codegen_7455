{"task_id": "Mbpp/409", "completion": "Here's the Python code to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef min_product_tuple(lst):\r\n    min_product = float('inf')\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\r\n            product = lst[i][0] * lst[j][1]\r\n            if product < min_product:\r\n                min_product = product\r\n    return min_product\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe initialize the minimum product to infinity and then loop through the list using two nested loops. For each pair of tuples, we calculate the product and check if it is less than the current minimum product. If it is, we update the minimum product. Finally, we return the minimum product. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef min_product_tuple(lst):\r\n    min_product = float('inf')\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\r\n            product = lst[i][0] * lst[j][1]\r\n            if product < min_product:\r\n                min_product = product\r\n    return min_product\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe initialize the minimum product to infinity and then loop through the list using two nested loops.
