{"task_id": "Mbpp/262", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function that takes a list and an integer L and returns a tuple of two lists:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\r\n    return lst[:L], lst[L:]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses slicing to split the list into two parts. The first part of the list is obtained by slicing the original list from the beginning up to index L-1, and the second part is obtained by slicing the original list from index L onwards. The first part is returned as the first element of the tuple, and the second part is returned as the second element of the tuple. \r\n\r\nFor example, if we call `split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)`, the function will return `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`. The first part of the list is `[1, 1, 2]` and the second part is `[3, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function that takes a list and an integer L and returns a tuple of two lists:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\r\n    return lst[:L], lst[L:]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses slicing to split the list into two parts.
