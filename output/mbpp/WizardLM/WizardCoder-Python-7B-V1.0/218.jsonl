{"task_id": "Mbpp/446", "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Occurrence(tuple_list, list_elements):\r\n    count_dict = {}\r\n    for element in list_elements:\r\n        count_dict[element] = tuple_list.count(element)\r\n    return count_dict\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We first create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the tuple.\r\n- We then loop through each element in the `list_elements` and use the `count()` method of the tuple to count the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.\r\n- We add the count of each element to the dictionary `count_dict` with the element as the key and its count as the value.\r\n- Finally, we return the dictionary `count_dict` which contains the count of each element in the tuple.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])\r\n{'a': 2, 'b': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function will return a dictionary with the count of each element in the tuple.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Occurrence(tuple_list, list_elements):\r\n    count_dict = {}\r\n    for element in list_elements:\r\n        count_dict[element] = tuple_list.count(element)\r\n    return count_dict\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- We first create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the tuple.\r\n- We then loop through each element in the `list_elements` and use the `count()` method of the tuple to count the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.\r\n- We add the count of each element to the dictionary `count_dict` with the element as the key and its count as the value.\r\n- Finally, we return the dictionary `count_dict` which contains the count of each element in the tuple.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])\r\n{'a': 2, 'b': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function will return a dictionary with the count of each element in the tuple.
