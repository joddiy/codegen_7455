Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to get the difference between two lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to get the difference between two lists:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\r\n    return [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements of the first list that are not present in the second list.
