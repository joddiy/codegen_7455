In this case, we pass in a list of lists as an argument and `zip()` returns a list of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the first element of each sublist and the i-th element of each sublist. We then use a list comprehension to convert each tuple to a list and return a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef merge(lst):\r\n    return [list(x) for x in zip(*lst)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe `zip()` function in Python takes multiple iterables and returns a list of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element of each iterable.
