{"task_id": "Mbpp/739", "completion": "Here's the Python code to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Index(n):\r\n    i = 1\r\n    while True:\r\n        triangular_num = i*(i+1)//2\r\n        if len(str(triangular_num)) == n:\r\n            return i\r\n        i += 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe can find the smallest triangular number with n digits by adding the first n natural numbers. For example, to find the smallest triangular number with 2 digits, we add 1+2=3, to find the smallest triangular number with 3 digits, we add 1+2+3=6, and so on. We can use a while loop to keep adding the natural numbers until we get a triangular number with n digits. We can use the formula for the nth triangular number to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers. Once we get a triangular number with n digits, we return the value of i, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.
