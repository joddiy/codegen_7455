", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function `swap_numbers` that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef swap_numbers(num1, num2):\r\n    return (num2, num1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two arguments `num1` and `num2` and returns a tuple with `num2` as the first element and `num1` as the second element.
