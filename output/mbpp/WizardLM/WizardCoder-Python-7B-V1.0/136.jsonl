{"task_id": "Mbpp/267", "completion": "Here's the Python function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef square_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n*2, 2):\r\n        sum += i**2\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the odd numbers from 1 to `n*2` (since the last odd number is `n*2-1`) and adds the square of each number to the `sum` variable. The `range` function is used with a step of 2 to only iterate through odd numbers. Finally, the function returns the `sum` variable. \r\n\r\nWhen we call `square_Sum(2)`, it will iterate through the odd numbers from 1 to 4 (1, 3, 5, 7), and the sum of their squares is 10.
