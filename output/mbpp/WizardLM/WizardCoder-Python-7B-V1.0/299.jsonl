We initialize an empty list `result` to store the average values of each tuple. We then loop through each tuple in the input tuple and calculate the average using the `sum` and `len` functions. We append the average value to the `result` list. Finally, we return the `result` list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))==[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for tup in tuples:\r\n        avg = sum(tup)/len(tup)\r\n        result.append(avg)\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe define a function `average_tuple` that takes a tuple of tuples as input.
