{"task_id": "Mbpp/420", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef cube_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, 2*n, 2):\r\n        sum += i**3\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. We start the range from 2 (the first even number) and increment by 2 to get only even numbers. We then add the cube of each even number to the `sum` variable and return it at the end. The assertion checks if the function returns the correct value for `n=2`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef cube_Sum(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, 2*n, 2):\r\n        sum += i**3\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
