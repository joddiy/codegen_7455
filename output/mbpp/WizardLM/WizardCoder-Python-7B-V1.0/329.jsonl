{"task_id": "Mbpp/728", "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function that takes two lists and returns their sum:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_list(a, b):\r\n    return [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(len(a))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two lists `a` and `b` as input and returns a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. We use a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of `a` and `b` and add the corresponding elements together. The `range(len(a))` function generates a sequence of indices from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of `a`. We then use this sequence to index into both `a` and `b` and add their corresponding elements together. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function takes as input two lists [a_1,...,a_n], [b_1,...,b_n] and returns [a_1+b_1,...,a_n+b_n]. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_list([10,20,30],[15,25,35])==[25,45,65]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function that takes two lists and returns their sum:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_list(a, b):\r\n    return [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(len(a))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two lists `a` and `b` as input and returns a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
