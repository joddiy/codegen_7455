Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_Char(string):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        sum += ord(char)\r\n    return chr(sum % 26 + 97)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n- We initialize a variable `sum` to 0.\r\n- We loop through each character in the string using a for loop and add its ASCII value to `sum`.\r\n- We then take the modulo of `sum` with 26 to get the sum of ASCII values of all the characters modulo 26.\r\n- Finally, we convert the result back to a character using the `chr()` function and return it.\r\n\r\nNote: We add 97 to the result of modulo to get the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
