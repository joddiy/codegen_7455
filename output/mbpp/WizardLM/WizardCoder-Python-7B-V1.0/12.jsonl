", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that removes characters from the first string which are present in the second string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\r\n    for char in str2:\r\n        str1 = str1.replace(char, '')\r\n    return str1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two strings as input, `str1` and `str2`.
