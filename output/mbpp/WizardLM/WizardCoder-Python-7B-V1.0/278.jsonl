", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef swap_List(lst):\r\n    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]\r\n    return lst\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list as input and swaps the first and last elements using tuple unpacking.
