", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth nonagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_nonagonal(10) == 325\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to find the nth nonagonal number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_nonagonal(n):\r\n    return n * (n * n * (n * 2 - 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe nth nonagonal number can be found by multiplying n with the square of n times (n-1).
