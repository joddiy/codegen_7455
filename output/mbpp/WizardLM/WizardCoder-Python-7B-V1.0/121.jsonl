Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the intersection of two arrays. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])==[1, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's one possible solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef intersection_array(arr1, arr2):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Returns the intersection of two arrays.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Create a set from the second array to make it faster for searching\r\n    arr2_set = set(arr2)\r\n    # Create an empty list to store the intersection\r\n    intersection = []\r\n    # Loop through the first array and check if each element is in the second array\r\n    for num in arr1:\r\n        if num in arr2_set:\r\n            intersection.append(num)\r\n    # Return the intersection list\r\n    return intersection\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution uses a set to create a faster way to search for elements in the second array.
