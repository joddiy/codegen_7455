{"task_id": "Mbpp/96", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the number of divisors of a given integer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef divisor(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if n % i == 0:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe initialize a variable `count` to 0 and then loop through all the numbers from 1 to `n`. If the number `i` is a divisor of `n`, we increment the count by 1. Finally, we return the count as the number of divisors of `n`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `n` is 15, the divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. So, the count will be 3. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the number of divisors of a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the number of divisors of a given integer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef divisor(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if n % i == 0:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe initialize a variable `count` to 0 and then loop through all the numbers from 1 to `n`.
