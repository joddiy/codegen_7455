Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether any value in a sequence exists in a sequence or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function that checks whether any value in a sequence exists in another sequence or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\r\n    for i in seq1:\r\n        if i in seq2:\r\n            return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two sequences as input and iterates through the first sequence.
