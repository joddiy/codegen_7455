", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\r\n    product = 1\r\n    for num in numbers:\r\n        product *= num\r\n    return product % 2 == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates their product.
