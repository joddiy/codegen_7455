Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code for the function to find the shared elements from the given two lists:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\r\n    return set(list1) & set(list2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `set()` function is used to convert the lists into sets, which automatically removes the duplicates and then the `&` operator is used to find the common elements between the two sets.
