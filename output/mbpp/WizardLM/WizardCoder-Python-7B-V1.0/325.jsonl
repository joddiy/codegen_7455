It checks if the values at each index are the same and increments a counter if they are. Finally, it returns the count of indices where the values are the same. The assertion test provided in the problem statement passes this function. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nThe input is defined as two lists of the same length. Write a function to count indices where the lists have the same values. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\r\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in two lists as input and iterates through them using a for loop.
