{"task_id": "Mbpp/608", "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the nth Bell number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef bell_Number(n):\r\n    if n == 1:\r\n        return 1\r\n    elif n == 2:\r\n        return 2\r\n    else:\r\n        bell = [1, 1]\r\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\r\n            bell.append(0)\r\n            for j in range(i):\r\n                bell[i] = bell[j] * (i - j) // (j + 1) + bell[j+1] * (j + 1)\r\n        return bell[n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses the Bell number formula to calculate the nth Bell number. The formula is:\r\n\r\nBell(n) = Bell(n-1) * (n-1) + Bell(n-2)\r\n\r\nThe first two Bell numbers are 1 and 2, so we initialize the list `bell` with these values. Then, for each value of n greater than 2, we calculate the nth Bell number by iterating over all values of j from 1 to n-1 and multiplying them with the corresponding Bell numbers and adding them up. The Bell numbers are stored in the list `bell` and returned at the end. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find nth bell number.
