{"task_id": "Mbpp/300", "completion": "Here's a Python function that finds the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of first n bits is equal to the sum of last n bits:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math\r\n\r\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\r\n    # Initialize variables\r\n    count = 0\r\n    total_count = 0\r\n    \r\n    # Loop through all possible binary sequences of length 2n\r\n    for i in range(2**(2*n):\r\n        # Check if the sum of first n bits is equal to the sum of last n bits\r\n        if sum(int(digit) for digit in bin(i)[:n]) == sum(int(digit) for digit in bin(i)[-n:]):\r\n            count += 1\r\n            \r\n    # Calculate the total count of binary sequences of length 2n\r\n    total_count = 2**(2*n)\r\n    \r\n    # Return the count of binary sequences that satisfy the condition\r\n    return count/total_count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function first initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of sequences that satisfy the condition and a total_count variable to keep track of the total number of binary sequences of length 2n. It then loops through all possible binary sequences of length 2n using a for loop and checks if the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits. If it is, then the count variable is incremented. Finally, it calculates the total count of binary sequences of length 2n and returns the count of binary sequences that satisfy the condition divided by the total count.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the assertion, we can test the function with n=1:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will check if the function returns a value that is close to 2.0 within a relative tolerance of 0.001. Since there are only two binary sequences of length 2 that satisfy the condition (00 and 11), the count will be 2 and the total count will be 4, so the function should return 0.5.
