We use the `math.pi` constant to get the value of \u03c0. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected value within a certain tolerance. The tolerance is set to 0.001, which means that if the difference between the actual and expected values is less than 0.001, it will be considered correct.\r\n\r\nTo use this function, simply call it with the desired values for `radius` and `height`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert math.isclose(volume_cone(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will check if the result is close to the expected value within a tolerance of 0.001.
