Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove all elements from a given list present in another list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\r\n    return [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two lists as input, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that contains only the elements of `list1` that are not present in `list2`.
