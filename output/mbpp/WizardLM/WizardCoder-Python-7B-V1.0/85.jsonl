Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the circumference of a circle. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible implementation of the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math\r\n\r\ndef circle_circumference(radius):\r\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a radius as input and returns the circumference of a circle with that radius.
