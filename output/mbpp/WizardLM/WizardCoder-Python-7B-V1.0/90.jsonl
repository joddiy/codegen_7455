The `max()` function is then used to find the maximum of these differences. The `abs()` function is used to ensure that negative differences are treated as positive. The function returns the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\r\n    return max(abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) for i in range(len(arr)) for j in range(len(arr)) if i != j)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate through all possible pairs of elements in the array and calculates their absolute difference.
