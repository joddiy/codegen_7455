It uses an if-else statement to compare the two numbers and return the smaller one. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`, otherwise it returns `b`. This works because the minimum of two numbers is always the smaller of the two. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the minimum of two numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert minimum(1,2) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef minimum(a, b):\r\n    if a < b:\r\n        return a\r\n    else:\r\n        return b\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two numbers as input and returns the minimum of the two.
