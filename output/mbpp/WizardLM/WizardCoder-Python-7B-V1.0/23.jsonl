Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef recursive_list_sum(lst):\r\n    total = 0\r\n    for item in lst:\r\n        if isinstance(item, list):\r\n            total += recursive_list_sum(item)\r\n        else:\r\n            total += item\r\n    return total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list as input and iterates over its elements.
