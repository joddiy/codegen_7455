{"task_id": "Mbpp/171", "completion": "Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\r\n    return 5 * side_length\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a single argument `side_length`, which is the length of one side of the regular pentagon, and returns the perimeter of the pentagon, which is simply the product of the number of sides and the length of each side. Since a regular pentagon has five sides, we can simply multiply the length of each side by 5 to get the perimeter. The function can be tested with the given assertion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis asserts that the function returns the correct value for a pentagon with side length 5. If the function passes this test, it should work correctly for any side length. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\n### Response:Here's a possible solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\r\n    return 5 * side_length\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a single argument `side_length`, which is the length of one side of the regular pentagon, and returns the perimeter of the pentagon, which is simply the product of the number of sides and the length of each side.
