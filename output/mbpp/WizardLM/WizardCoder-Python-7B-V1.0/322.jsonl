The output should be a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})\n```\n\n### Response:Here's the Python code to add a dictionary to a tuple:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict_val):\r\n    return tup + (dict_val,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a tuple `tup` and a dictionary `dict_val` as arguments.
