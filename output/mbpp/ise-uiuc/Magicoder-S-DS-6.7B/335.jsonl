{"task_id": "Mbpp/735", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n):\n    # Calculate the number of bits in the number\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n\n    # If the number is 0 or 1, return the number itself\n    if num_bits <= 2:\n        return n\n\n    # Calculate the mask for the middle bits\n    mask = (1 << (num_bits - 2)) - 1\n\n    # Toggle the middle bits\n    n = n ^ mask\n\n    return n\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the number of bits in the input number. If the number is 0 or 1, it returns the number itself because there are no bits to toggle. If the number has more than 2 bits, it calculates a mask that covers all the middle bits. The mask is calculated by shifting a 1 bit left by the number of bits minus 2, and then subtracting 1. This mask is then used to toggle the middle bits of the number. The toggling is done by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the mask.\n\nThe assertion in the problem statement should pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n):\n    # Calculate the number of bits in the number\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n\n    # If the number is 0 or 1, return the number itself\n    if num_bits <= 2:\n        return n\n\n    # Calculate the mask for the middle bits\n    mask = (1 << (num_bits - 2)) - 1\n\n    # Toggle the middle bits\n    n = n ^ mask\n\n    return n\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the number of bits in the input number.
