Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef substract_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n\nassert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `substract_elements` that takes two tuples as arguments.
