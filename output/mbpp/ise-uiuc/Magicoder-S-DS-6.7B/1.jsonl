{"task_id": "Mbpp/3", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if a number is not prime:\n\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return True\n    if n <= 3:\n        return False\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return True\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return True\n        i += 6\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then it checks if the number is less than or equal to 3, in which case it is prime. After that, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, in which case it is not prime. If none of these conditions are met, it then checks for divisibility by all numbers of the form 6k \u00b1 1 up to the square root of the number, as these are the only possible factors of a composite number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\nThe assertion `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` is satisfied by this function, as 2 is a prime number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
