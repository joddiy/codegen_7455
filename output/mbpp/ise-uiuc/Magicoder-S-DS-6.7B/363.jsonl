For each number, it calculates the complement that would make the sum equal to the target sum. If the complement is in the dictionary, it means we have found a pair whose sum is equal to the target sum, so we increment the count. Then, it updates the dictionary with the current number.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list of numbers. This is because we are iterating through the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario, we will have to store all the numbers in the dictionary.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of pairs whose sum is equal to \u2018sum\u2019. The funtion gets as input a list of numbers and the sum,. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_pairs_count([1,1,1,1],2) == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n    count = 0\n    num_dict = {}\n    for num in numbers:\n        complement = target_sum - num\n        if complement in num_dict:\n            count += num_dict[complement]\n        if num in num_dict:\n            num_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            num_dict[num] = 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through the list of numbers.
