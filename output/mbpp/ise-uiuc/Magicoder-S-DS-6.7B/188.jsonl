Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(lst):\n    return min(x*y for x, y in lst)\n\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `min_product_tuple` that takes a list of tuples as input.
