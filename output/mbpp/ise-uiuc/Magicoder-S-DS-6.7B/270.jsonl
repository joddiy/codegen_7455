For example:\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {10: 'value'}\nprint(is_dict_empty(my_dict))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis function works by using the built-in `bool()` function to check if the dictionary is empty.

The `not` operator is used to invert this result, so if the dictionary is empty, `is_dict_empty()` will return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`.\n\nThe assertion `assert my_dict({10})==False` is incorrect because it's trying to call the function `my_dict` with a dictionary as an argument, which is not what the function is designed to do.
