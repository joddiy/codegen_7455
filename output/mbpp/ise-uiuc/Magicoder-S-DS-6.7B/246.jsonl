Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Split(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list and return a new list that only contains the odd numbers.
