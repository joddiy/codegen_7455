{"task_id": "Mbpp/138", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses a greedy approach to solve this problem. It starts from the largest power of 2 and subtracts it from the given number if it is greater than or equal to the current power of 2. The process is repeated until the number becomes 0. If the number becomes 0 at any point, it means the given number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2.\n\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n    # Start from the largest power of 2\n    power = 1 << 30\n\n    # Continue until the power becomes 0\n    while power > 0:\n        # If the current power of 2 is greater than or equal to n, subtract it\n        if power <= n:\n            n -= power\n\n        # If n becomes 0, return True\n        if n == 0:\n            return True\n\n        # Reduce the power of 2\n        power >>= 1\n\n    # If n is not 0 after the loop, return False\n    return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True\n```\n\nThis function works by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given number, and checking if the result is 0. If it is, the number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2. If it is not, the function continues with the next largest power of 2. This process continues until the power of 2 becomes 0, at which point the function returns True if the number is 0 and False otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
