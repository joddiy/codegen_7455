Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple:\n\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tup, lst):\n    count = 0\n    for i in lst:\n        count += tup.count(i)\n    return count\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly."}
