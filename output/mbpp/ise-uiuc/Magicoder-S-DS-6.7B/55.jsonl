Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef kth_element(arr, k):\n    return arr[k-1]\n\nassert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3\n```\n\nThis function takes in an array and a number k, and returns the kth element in the array.
