It initializes a variable `total` to 0, then iterates over each tuple in the list. For each tuple, it adds the sum of its elements to `total`. Finally, it returns `total`, which is the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuples. The assertion at the end verifies that the function works correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef cummulative_sum(tuple_list):\n    total = 0\n    for tup in tuple_list:\n        total += sum(tup)\n    return total\n\nassert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `cummulative_sum` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.
