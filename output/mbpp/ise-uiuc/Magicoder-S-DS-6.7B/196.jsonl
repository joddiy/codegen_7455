Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers:\n\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2):\n        sum += i**3\n    return sum\n\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first n even natural numbers (2, 4, ..., 2n), cubing each number, and adding it to the running total.
