Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis function takes a list as input, and uses Python's list indexing to swap the first and last elements.
