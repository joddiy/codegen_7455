It calculates the power of the base and converts the result to a string. Then it sums up all the digits in the string by converting each digit back to an integer. The `assert` statement checks if the function works correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert power_base_sum(2,100)==115\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef power_base_sum(base, power):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(base**power))\n\nassert power_base_sum(2,100)==115\n```\n\nIn this script, the `power_base_sum` function takes two arguments: `base` and `power`.
