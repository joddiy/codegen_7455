Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the product of the array multiplication modulo n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product = (product * num) % n\n    return product\n\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) == 9\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `find_remainder` that takes in an array `arr` and a number `n`.
