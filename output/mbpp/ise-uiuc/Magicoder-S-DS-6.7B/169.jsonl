Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the maximum of two numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximum(5,10) == 10\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that finds the maximum of two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef maximum(num1, num2):\n    return max(num1, num2)\n\nassert maximum(5,10) == 10\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `max()` function in Python which returns the largest of the input values.
