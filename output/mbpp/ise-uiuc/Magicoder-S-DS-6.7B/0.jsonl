Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    return set(list1) & set(list2)\n\nassert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of two sets, which are created from the input lists.
