It does this by checking if `num` is divisible by any number up to its square root. If `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`. If `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, so the function returns `True`.\n\nThen, the main function `count_Primes_nums(n)` counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`. It does this by iterating over all numbers less than `n` and checking if each one is prime. If a number is prime, it increments the count.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\n    def is_prime(num):\n        if num < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a helper function `is_prime(num)` that checks if a number is prime.
