Write a function to filter students that have height and weight above the minimum. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert filter_data({'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65), 'Kierra Gentry': (6.0, 68), 'Pierre Cox': (5.8, 66)},6.0,70)=={'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef filter_data(student_data, min_height, min_weight):\n    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_data.items() if height > min_height and weight > min_weight}\n\n# Test the function\nassert filter_data({'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65), 'Kierra Gentry': (6.0, 68), 'Pierre Cox': (5.8, 66)},6.0,70)=={'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `filter_data` that takes a dictionary `student_data`, and two numbers `min_height` and `min_weight` as inputs.
