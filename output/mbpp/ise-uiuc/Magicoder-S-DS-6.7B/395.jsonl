Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find maximum run of uppercase characters in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_run_uppercase(s):\n    max_run = 0\n    current_run = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            current_run += 1\n            max_run = max(max_run, current_run)\n        else:\n            current_run = 0\n    return max_run\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each character in the string.
