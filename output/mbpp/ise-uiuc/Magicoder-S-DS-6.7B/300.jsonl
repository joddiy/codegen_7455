Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function which takes two tuples of the same length and performs the element wise modulo. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that performs the element wise modulo operation on two tuples:\n\n```python\ndef tuple_modulo(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a % b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly."}
