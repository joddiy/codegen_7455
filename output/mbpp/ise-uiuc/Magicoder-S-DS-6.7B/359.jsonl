Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_min_diff(arr, n):\n    arr.sort()\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n    return min_diff\n\nassert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the array in ascending order.
