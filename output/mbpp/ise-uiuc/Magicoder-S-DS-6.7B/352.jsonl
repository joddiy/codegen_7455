Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWe say that an element is common for lists l1, l2, l3 if it appears in all three lists under the same index. Write a function to find common elements from three lists. The function should return a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    return [l1[i] for i in range(len(l1)) if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the indices of the first list.
