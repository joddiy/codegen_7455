{"task_id": "Mbpp/755", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    m1, m2 = float('inf'), float('inf')\n    for x in numbers:\n        if x <= m1:\n            m1, m2 = x, m1\n        elif x < m2:\n            m2 = x\n    return m2\n```\n\nThis function initializes two variables, m1 and m2, to positive infinity. It then iterates over the list of numbers. If it encounters a number that is less than or equal to m1, it updates m1 and m2. If it encounters a number that is greater than m1 but less than m2, it updates m2. After the loop, m2 will hold the second smallest number in the list.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, the function is correct.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    m1, m2 = float('inf'), float('inf')\n    for x in numbers:\n        if x <= m1:\n            m1, m2 = x, m1\n        elif x < m2:\n            m2 = x\n    return m2\n```\n\nThis function initializes two variables, m1 and m2, to positive infinity.
