Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef find(num1, num2):\n    return num1 // num2\n\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\nThis function uses the floor division operator (//) to find the quotient of two numbers.
