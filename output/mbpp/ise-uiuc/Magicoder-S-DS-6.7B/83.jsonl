Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef zero_count(arr):\n    zero_count = sum(1 for i in arr if i == 0)\n    non_zero_count = sum(1 for i in arr if i != 0)\n    return zero_count / non_zero_count if non_zero_count != 0 else 0\n\nimport math\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `zero_count` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes.
