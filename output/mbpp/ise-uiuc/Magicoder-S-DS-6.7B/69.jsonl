{"task_id": "Mbpp/119", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses a binary search approach to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array:\n\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1]:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n\n    return arr[low]\n\nassert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3\n```\n\nThis function works by repeatedly dividing the array into two halves until it finds the element that appears only once. The binary search is used to find the element, and the XOR operation is used to determine whether the midpoint is at an even or odd index. If the midpoint is at an even index, the next element is the same, so the search is continued in the right half of the array. If the midpoint is at an odd index, the previous element is the same, so the search is continued in the left half of the array.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(log n), which is the best possible time complexity for this problem. The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that uses a binary search approach to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array:\n\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1]:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n\n    return arr[low]\n\nassert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3\n```\n\nThis function works by repeatedly dividing the array into two halves until it finds the element that appears only once.
