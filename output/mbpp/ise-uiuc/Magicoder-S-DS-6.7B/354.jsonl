For each string, it checks if it's in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count. If it's not, it adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Then, it checks if the reverse of the string is in the dictionary. If it is, it decrements the count. If it's not, it adds it to the dictionary with a count of -1. Finally, it returns the sum of the absolute values of the counts divided by 2, which is the number of pairs of reverse strings.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
