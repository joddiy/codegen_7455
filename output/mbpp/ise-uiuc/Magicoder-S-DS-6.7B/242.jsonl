Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert big_sum([1,2,3]) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef big_sum(arr):\n    return min(arr) + max(arr)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions in Python to find the smallest and largest values in the array, respectively.
