{"task_id": "Mbpp/234", "completion": "\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length):\n    return side_length ** 3\n\n# Test the function\nassert volume_cube(3)==27\n```\n\nIn this function, we simply return the cube of the side length. This is because the volume of a cube is given by the side length cubed. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the correct volume for a side length of 3, the assertion will pass. If not, it will raise an `AssertionError`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the volume of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert volume_cube(3)==27\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length):\n    return side_length ** 3\n\n# Test the function\nassert volume_cube(3)==27\n```\n\nIn this function, we simply return the cube of the side length.
