{"task_id": "Mbpp/84", "completion": "\nThe Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. It starts with 1, 1.\n\nHere is a Python function that generates the Newman-Conway sequence:\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        seq = [1, 1]\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            seq.append(seq[seq[i-1]-1] + seq[i-seq[i-1]])\n        return seq[-1]\n\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\nThis function works by first initializing the sequence with the first two numbers (1 and 1). Then, it iteratively calculates each subsequent number in the sequence by adding the numbers at the indices specified by the previous two numbers in the sequence. The function returns the nth number in the sequence.\n\nThe assertion `assert sequence(10) == 6` checks if the 10th number in the sequence is 6.
