Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to get the frequency of all the elements in a list, returned as a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    freq_dict = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        if item in freq_dict:\n            freq_dict[item] += 1\n        else:\n            freq_dict[item] = 1\n    return freq_dict\n\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `freq_count` that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in the list and the values are their corresponding frequencies.
