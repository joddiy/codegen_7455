Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to concatenate each element of tuple by the delimiter. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert concatenate_tuple((\"ID\", \"is\", 4, \"UTS\") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef concatenate_tuple(tup, delimiter='-'):\n    return delimiter.join(str(x) for x in tup)\n\nassert concatenate_tuple((\"ID\", \"is\", 4, \"UTS\")) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple and a delimiter as input.
