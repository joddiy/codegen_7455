{"task_id": "Mbpp/778", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses the itertools.groupby function to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    return [[k]*len(list(g)) for k, g in groupby(lst)]\n\nassert pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])==[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]\n```\n\nThis function works by grouping consecutive elements in the list using the groupby function from the itertools module. It then creates a sublist for each group, where each element in the sublist is the group's key (the duplicate value). The length of the sublist is determined by the number of elements in the group.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to pack consecutive duplicates of a given list elements into sublists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])==[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that uses the itertools.groupby function to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    return [[k]*len(list(g)) for k, g in groupby(lst)]\n\nassert pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])==[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]\n```\n\nThis function works by grouping consecutive elements in the list using the groupby function from the itertools module.
