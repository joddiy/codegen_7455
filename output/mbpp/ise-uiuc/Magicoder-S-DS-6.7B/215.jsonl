The `assert` statement is used to test the function, ensuring that it returns the expected result for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the surface area of a cube of a given size.
