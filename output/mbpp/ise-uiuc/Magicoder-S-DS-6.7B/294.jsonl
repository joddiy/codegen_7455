The first row of the array is initialized with 1, and then for each subsequent row, the first element is the Bell number of the previous row's last element, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous row's element and the current row's previous element. The function then returns the first element of the nth row, which is the nth Bell number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find nth bell number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert bell_Number(2) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the nth Bell number using dynamic programming.\n\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n):\n    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n    return bell[n][0]\n\n# Test the function\nassert bell_Number(2) == 2\n```\n\nThis function uses a 2D array `bell` to store the Bell numbers.
