Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_rear(tup):\n    return [s[-1] for s in tup]\n\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `extract_rear` that takes a tuple of strings as input.
