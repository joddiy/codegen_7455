Subtracting 1 from this value gives the position of the most significant bit. The `2 **` operation raises 2 to that power, which gives the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass without any errors.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()\n```\n\nThis function works by using the bitwise operation `bit_length()`, which returns the number of bits needed to represent an integer in binary.
