Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_Char(s):\n    return chr((sum(ord(c) for c in s) % 26) + ord('a'))\n\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\nThis function works by summing the ASCII values of all the characters in the string, then taking the modulo 26 of that sum.
