Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_Parity(n):\n    return n % 2 != 0\n\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\nThis function uses the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of the input number by 2.
