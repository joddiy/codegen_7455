{"task_id": "Mbpp/775", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if every odd index contains an odd number:\n\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list with a step of 2 (which includes only the odd indices), and checks if the number at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it doesn't find any even numbers, it returns `True`.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, as all numbers at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if every odd index contains an odd number:\n\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list with a step of 2 (which includes only the odd indices), and checks if the number at each odd index is even.
