It then multiplies the number of subarrays by the element and adds it to the result.\n\nThe number of subarrays that include an element is given by the formula `(i + 1) * (n - i)`, where `i` is the index of the element in the array. The number of times an element will appear in those subarrays is given by `(i + 1) * (n - i) + 1`. This is because each subarray of odd length that includes the element will appear `(i + 1) * (n - i)` times, and the subarray that only includes the element will also appear `(i + 1) * (n - i) + 1` times.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
