Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) ) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_first_elements(tup):\n    count = 0\n    for i in tup:\n        if isinstance(i, tuple):\n            break\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) ) == 3\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the elements in the tuple.
