The list `months_with_31_days` contains the month numbers of the months that have 31 days. The function checks if the input month number is in this list and returns the appropriate boolean value. The assertion at the end tests the function with the given example.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_monthnumb_number(5)==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month_number):\n    # List of months with 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]\n    \n    # Check if the month number is in the list of months with 31 days\n    if month_number in months_with_31_days:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert check_monthnumb_number(5)==True\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes a month number as input and returns `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.
