Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\n    # Months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9) and November (11)\n    return month_number in [4, 6, 9, 11]\n\n# Test the function\nassert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `check_monthnumber_number` that takes a month number as input and returns `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.
