Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)] ) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_freq(lst):\n    unique_tuples = set(lst)\n    return len(unique_tuples)\n\nassert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)]) == 3\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `extract_freq` that takes a list of tuples as input.
