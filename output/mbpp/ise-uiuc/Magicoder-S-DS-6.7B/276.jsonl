Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    return [i**2 for i in range(int(start**0.5), int(end**0.5)+1)]\n\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the square root of the start and end numbers, rounding down to the nearest integer (since perfect squares are always integers), and then using a list comprehension to generate a list of squares within the range.
