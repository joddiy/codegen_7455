Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert power(3,4) == 81\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the value of 'a' to the power 'b' using the built-in `**` operator:\n\n```python\ndef power(a, b):\n    return a ** b\n\nassert power(3,4) == 81\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `**` operator, which raises the number on the left to the power of the number on the right.
