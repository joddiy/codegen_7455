Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])==2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    freq_dict = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        if item in freq_dict:\n            freq_dict[item] += 1\n        else:\n            freq_dict[item] = 1\n    max_freq = max(freq_dict.values())\n    for item, freq in freq_dict.items():\n        if freq == max_freq:\n            return item\n\nassert max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])==2\n```\n\nThis script works by first creating a dictionary where the keys are the items in the list and the values are the frequencies of those items.
