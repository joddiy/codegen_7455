Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of non-empty substrings of a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function works by calculating the number of substrings for a string of length n by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
