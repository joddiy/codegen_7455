{"task_id": "Mbpp/262", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    return lst[:L], lst[L:]\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list into two parts. The first part is from the start of the list up to index L, and the second part is from index L to the end of the list. The function then returns these two parts as a tuple.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    return lst[:L], lst[L:]\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list into two parts.
