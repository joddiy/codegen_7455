Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to filter odd numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert filter_oddnumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1,3,5,7,9]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that filters odd numbers from a list:\n\n```python\ndef filter_oddnumbers(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n\nassert filter_oddnumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1,3,5,7,9]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and only include numbers that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., are odd).
