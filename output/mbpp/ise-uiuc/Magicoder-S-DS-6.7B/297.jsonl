Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef merge(lst):\n    return [list(x) for x in zip(*lst)]\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `zip` function in Python, which takes iterables (like lists) and returns an iterator of tuples.
