It iterates through the list, checking each number to see if it is even or odd. If it is even and there is no previously found even number, it sets this number as the current even number. If it is odd and there is no previously found odd number, it sets this number as the current odd number.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(lst):\n    even_num = None\n    odd_num = None\n    for num in lst:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            if even_num is None:\n                even_num = num\n            else:\n                return \"More than one even number in the list\"\n        else:\n            if odd_num is None:\n                odd_num = num\n            else:\n                return \"More than one odd number in the list\"\n    if even_num is None or odd_num is None:\n        return \"No even or odd number in the list\"\n    return even_num * odd_num\n\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `mul_even_odd` that takes a list of numbers as input.
