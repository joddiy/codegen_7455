The comb sort algorithm is a variation of bubble sort that reduces the gap between elements to be sorted by a factor of 1.3 with each pass. The gap is initially set to the length of the list, and is reduced by a factor of 1.3 after each pass. The algorithm continues until the gap is 1, at which point it sorts the list.
