Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand') == 'Iloveyouthreethousand1143553000'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef move_num(s):\n    nums = [i for i in s if i.isdigit()]\n    chars = [i for i in s if not i.isdigit()]\n    return ''.join(chars + nums)\n\nassert move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand') == 'Iloveyouthreethousand1143553000'\n```\n\nThis script works by first creating two lists: one for the numbers and one for the characters.
