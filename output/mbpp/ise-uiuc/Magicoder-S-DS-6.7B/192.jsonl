Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether any value in a sequence exists in a sequence or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if any value in a sequence exists in another sequence:\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    for i in seq1:\n        if i in seq2:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly."}
