Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_words(\"python program\")==(\"program python\")\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s):\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    reversed_words = ' '.join(reversed(words))\n    return reversed_words\n\nassert reverse_words(\"python program\")==(\"program python\")\n```\n\nThis script first splits the input string into a list of words using the `split` method.
