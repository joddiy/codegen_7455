Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(text):\n    words = text.split()\n    for word in words:\n        if len(word) > 2 and word[0] != 'z' and word[-1] != 'z' and 'z' in word[1:-1]:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\nThis script splits the input text into words and then checks each word.
