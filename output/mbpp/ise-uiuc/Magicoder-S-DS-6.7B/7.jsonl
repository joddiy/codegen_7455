If the character is found, it then finds the last occurrence of the character in the string. If the last occurrence is not the same as the first occurrence, it removes the first and last occurrence of the character from the string.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(string, char):\n    first_occurrence = string.find(char)\n    if first_occurrence != -1:\n        last_occurrence = string.rfind(char)\n        if last_occurrence != first_occurrence:\n            string = string[:first_occurrence] + string[first_occurrence+1:last_occurrence] + string[last_occurrence+1:]\n    return string\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the first occurrence of the character in the string.
