Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of set bits in a given number:\n\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n:\n        count += n & 1\n        n >>= 1\n    return count\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by using bitwise operations.
