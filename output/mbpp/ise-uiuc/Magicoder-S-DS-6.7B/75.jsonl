Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to multiply two integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiply_int(10,20)==200\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a simple Python function that multiplies two integers:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_int(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\nassert multiply_int(10, 20) == 200\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their product.
