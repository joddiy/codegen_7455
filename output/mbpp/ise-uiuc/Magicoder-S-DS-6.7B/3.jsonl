Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if two numbers differ at one bit position only:\n\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    # XOR operation to find the bit positions where the numbers differ\n    xor_result = num1 ^ num2\n\n    # Count the number of set bits in the XOR result\n    count = 0\n    while xor_result:\n        count += xor_result & 1\n        xor_result >>= 1\n\n    # If the count is exactly 1, then the numbers differ at one bit position only\n    return count == 1\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\nThis function works by first performing an XOR operation on the two input numbers.
