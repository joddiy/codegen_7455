Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides:\n\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    return 5 * side_length\n\n# Test the function\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\nThis function works by multiplying the number of sides (5 in this case) by the length of each side.
