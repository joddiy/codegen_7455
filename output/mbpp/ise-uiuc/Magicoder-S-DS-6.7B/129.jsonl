Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef maximize_elements(tuples1, tuples2):\n    result = []\n    for t1, t2 in zip(tuples1, tuples2):\n        result.append((max(t1[0], t2[0]), max(t1[1], t2[1])))\n    return tuple(result)\n\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `maximize_elements` that takes two tuples as input.
