{"task_id": "Mbpp/249", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses the built-in `set` data type to find the intersection of two arrays:\n\n```python\ndef intersection_array(arr1, arr2):\n    set1 = set(arr1)\n    set2 = set(arr2)\n    return list(set1 & set2)\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input arrays to sets. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of two sets.
