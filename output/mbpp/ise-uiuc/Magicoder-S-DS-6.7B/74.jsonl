Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum(10,15) == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_common_divisors(num1, num2):\n    # Find the smaller number\n    min_num = min(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Initialize sum of common divisors\n    sum_divisors = 0\n    \n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to min_num\n    for i in range(1, min_num + 1):\n        # If i is a common divisor, add it to the sum\n        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:\n            sum_divisors += i\n            \n    return sum_divisors\n\n# Test the function\nassert sum_common_divisors(10, 15) == 6\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through all numbers from 1 to the smaller of the two input numbers.
