Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes characters from the first string which are present in the second string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\n    for char in str2:\n        str1 = str1.replace(char, '')\n    return str1\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the second string and replacing it in the first string with nothing.
