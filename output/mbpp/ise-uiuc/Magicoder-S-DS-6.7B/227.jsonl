{"task_id": "Mbpp/457", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min(lst):\n    return min(lst, key=len)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. The `key` parameter is a function that computes a key value for each element in the iterable. In this case, we use `len` as the key function, which returns the length of each sublist.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass without any error, indicating that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sublist having minimum length.
