Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer, returned as an integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n    # Increment n by 1 and convert to string\n    n = str(n + 1)\n    # Check if n is a palindrome\n    while n != n[::-1]:\n        # If not, increment n by 1\n        n = str(int(n) + 1)\n    # Return the next smallest palindrome\n    return int(n)\n\nassert next_smallest_palindrome(99) == 101\n```\n\nThis script works by incrementing the input number by 1 and checking if the resulting number is a palindrome.
