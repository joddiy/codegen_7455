Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to remove odd numbers from a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes odd numbers from a given list:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the list.
