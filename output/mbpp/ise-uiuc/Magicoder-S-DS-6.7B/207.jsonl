It then subtracts the maximum and minimum lengths from this sum, and divides the result by 2 to get the median length.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the median length of a trapezium. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert median_trapezium(15,25,35)==20\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the median length of a trapezium:\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the median length\n    median = (2 * (a + b + c) - max(a, b, c) - min(a, b, c)) / 2\n    return median\n\n# Test the function\nassert median_trapezium(15, 25, 35) == 20\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the sum of the lengths of the sides of the trapezium.
