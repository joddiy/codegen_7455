Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, num):\n    # Combine the two lists\n    combined = [(a, b) for a in list1 for b in list2]\n    # Sort the combined list in descending order based on the product of the factors\n    combined.sort(key=lambda x: x[0]*x[1], reverse=True)\n    # Return the first 'num' products\n    return [x[0]*x[1] for x in combined[:num]]\n\n# Test the function\nassert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]\n```\n\nThis script first combines the two input lists into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one factor from each list.
