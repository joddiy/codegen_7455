Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of xor of all pairs of numbers in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef pair_xor_Sum(lst, n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            sum += lst[i] ^ lst[j]\n    return sum\n\nassert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the list and calculating the bitwise XOR of each pair.
