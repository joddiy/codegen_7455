Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    return sum(i**2 for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2))\n\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to generate the squares of the first n even natural numbers, and then uses the built-in sum function to add them up.
