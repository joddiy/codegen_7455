The formula for the sum of the first n cubes is n*(n+1)*(n+2)/6. By dividing the second formula by 6, we get the formula for the sum of the first n tetrahedral numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth tetrahedral number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a simple Python function that calculates the nth tetrahedral number:\n\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\n    return n*(n+1)*(n+2)//6\n\nassert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)/2.
