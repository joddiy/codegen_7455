The `isinstance()` function is used to check if each element is an integer. If it is, the expression `1` is returned, which is then summed up by the `sum()` function.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of integer elements in a list:\n\n```python\ndef count_integer(lst):\n    return sum(1 for i in lst if isinstance(i, int))\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements in the list.
