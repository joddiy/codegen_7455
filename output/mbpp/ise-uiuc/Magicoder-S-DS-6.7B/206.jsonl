Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\n    for i in list1:\n        if i in list2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the first list and checking if it is in the second list.
