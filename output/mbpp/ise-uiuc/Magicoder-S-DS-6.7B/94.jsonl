It does this by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and adding the current number to the sum if `n` is divisible by the current number.\n\nThe main function `are_equivalent(a, b)` then uses these helper functions to calculate the sum of the divisors of `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks that the function works correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert are_equivalent(36, 57) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_divisors(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n\ndef are_equivalent(a, b):\n    return sum_divisors(a) == sum_divisors(b)\n\nassert are_equivalent(36, 57) == False\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a helper function `sum_divisors(n)` that calculates the sum of the divisors of a number `n`.
