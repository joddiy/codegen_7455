Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find sum and average of first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_average(n):\n    sum_num = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    avg_num = sum_num / n\n    return (sum_num, avg_num)\n\nassert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)/2.
