The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the tuple. If `i` is an instance of the list class (i.e., it's a list), the generator expression yields `1`.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find number of lists present in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_lists(t):\n    return sum(1 for i in t if isinstance(i, list))\n\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `find_lists` that takes a tuple `t` as input.
