Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lst):\n    return min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)\n\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to find the length of each sublist in the input list, then uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest length.
