It then returns a new list containing these first elements.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to get the first element of each sublist. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Extract(lst):\n    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extract the first element.
