It then adds these areas together to get the total surface area of the square pyramid. The `assert` statement at the end is used to test the function with the provided example.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert surface_Area(3,4) == 33\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the surface area of a square pyramid:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef surface_Area(base_edge, height):\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = base_edge ** 2\n    \n    # Calculate the area of the lateral surfaces\n    lateral_area = 4 * base_edge * height\n    \n    # Calculate the area of the top surface\n    top_area = 1/2 * base_edge ** 2\n    \n    # Add up all the areas to get the total surface area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area + top_area\n    \n    return total_surface_area\n\n# Test the function\nassert surface_Area(3,4) == 33\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the area of the base, the area of the lateral surfaces, and the area of the top surface.
