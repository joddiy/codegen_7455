Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_substring([\"red\", \"black\", \"white\", \"green\", \"orange\"],\"ack\")==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(lst, sub):\n    for item in lst:\n        if sub in item:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert find_substring([\"red\", \"black\", \"white\", \"green\", \"orange\"],\"ack\")==True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each item in the list and checks if the substring is present in the item.
