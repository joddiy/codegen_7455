The volume of a cylinder is calculated as `\u03c0 * radius^2 * height`. The `assert` statement checks if the function `volume_cylinder` returns the expected volume. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected result within a relative tolerance of 0.001.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cylinder(radius, height):\n    return math.pi * radius**2 * height\n\nassert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `volume_cylinder` takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume.
