{"task_id": "Mbpp/781", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks whether the count of divisors is even:\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n        i += 1\n    return count % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating from 1 to n and incrementing a counter each time n is divisible by the current number. It then checks if the count is even by checking if the remainder of the count divided by 2 is 0. If the count is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert count_divisors(10)\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, as the number 10 has 4 divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), which is an even number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
