Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to reverse only the vowels of a given string (where y is not a vowel). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s):\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n    s = list(s)\n    i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n    while i < j:\n        if s[i] not in vowels:\n            i += 1\n        elif s[j] not in vowels:\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n            i, j = i + 1, j - 1\n    return ''.join(s)\n\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the string from both ends, swapping vowels it finds.
