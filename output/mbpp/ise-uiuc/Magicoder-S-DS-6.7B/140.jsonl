Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that takes in an integer n and finds the sum of the first n even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2):\n        sum += i**5\n    return sum\n\nassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first `n` even natural numbers (from 2 to 2n) and adding the fifth power of each number to a running total.
