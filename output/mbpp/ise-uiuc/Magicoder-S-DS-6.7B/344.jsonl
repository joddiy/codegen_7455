Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n    result = []\n    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):\n        if all(num % int(digit) == 0 for digit in str(num)):\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n\nassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `divisible_by_digits` that takes two arguments: `startnum` and `endnum`.
