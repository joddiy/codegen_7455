{"task_id": "Mbpp/741", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if all characters in a string are the same:\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(string):\n    return len(set(string)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the string into a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. If all characters in the string are the same, the set will only contain one element. Therefore, if the length of the set is equal to 1, all characters are the same.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, as \"python\" contains different characters.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if all characters in a string are the same:\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(string):\n    return len(set(string)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the string into a set.
