Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l, r):\n    return sum(i for i in range(l, r+1) if i % 2 != 0)\n\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range from l to r (inclusive) and checks if each number is odd by checking if the remainder of the division by 2 is not equal to 0.
