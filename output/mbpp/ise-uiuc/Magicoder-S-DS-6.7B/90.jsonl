Then, it subtracts the minimum from the maximum to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    return max(arr) - min(arr)\n\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in min() and max() functions in Python.
