Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)])) == set([3, 4, 5, 7, 1])\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_singly(lst):\n    return [item for sublist in lst for item in sublist]\n\nassert set(extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)])) == set([3, 4, 5, 7, 1])\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `extract_singly` that takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of all the items in the input lists.
