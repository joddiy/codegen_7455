If the remainder is 0, then the number is divisible by 11, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The `assert` statement checks if the function is working as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find whether a number is divisible by 11. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Diff (12345) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a number is divisible by 11:\n\n```python\ndef is_Diff(num):\n    return num % 11 == 0\n\nassert is_Diff(12345) == False\n```\n\nThis function works by using the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the number divided by 11.
