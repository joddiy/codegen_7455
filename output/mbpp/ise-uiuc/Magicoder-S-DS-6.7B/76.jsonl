Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert long_words(3,\"python is a programming language\")==['python','programming','language']\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef long_words(n, sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) > n]\n    return long_words\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert long_words(3, \"python is a programming language\") == ['python','programming','language']\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the sentence into words, then using a list comprehension to filter out the words that are longer than `n` characters.
