Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes all the words with a certain length from a given string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]\n    return ' '.join(words)\n\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into a list of words, then filtering out the words that have a length equal to `k`.
