Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count number of digits in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of digits in a given string:\n\n```python\ndef number_ctr(s):\n    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `isdigit()` method to check if each character in the string is a digit.
