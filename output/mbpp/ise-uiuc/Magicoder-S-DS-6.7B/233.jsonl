Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the maximum product subarray of the given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_subarray_product([1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2]) == 112\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    max_product = min_product = result = nums[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] < 0:\n            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n\n        max_product = max(nums[i], max_product * nums[i])\n        min_product = min(nums[i], min_product * nums[i])\n\n        result = max(result, max_product)\n\n    return result\n\nassert max_subarray_product([1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2]) == 112\n```\n\nThis script uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum product subarray.
