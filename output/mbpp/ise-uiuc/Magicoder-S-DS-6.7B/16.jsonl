This is done so that the largest possible number can be formed by concatenating the sorted digits. Then, it joins the sorted digits into a string and converts it to an integer. The result is the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_Max_Num(digits):\n    # Sort the list in descending order\n    digits.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Join the list elements into a string and convert it to integer\n    max_num = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))\n    \n    return max_num\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting the list of digits in descending order.
