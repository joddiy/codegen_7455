{"task_id": "Mbpp/418", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(lst):\n    return max(lst, key=len)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `max` function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. The `key` parameter is a function that computes a key value for each element in the iterable. In this case, the `key` function is `len`, which returns the length of each sublist.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(lst):\n    return max(lst, key=len)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `max` function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.
