Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s):\n    char_dict = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_dict:\n            return char\n        else:\n            char_dict[char] = 1\n    return None\n\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string.
