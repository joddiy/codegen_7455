It initializes the first element of the list to be the first element of the array. Then, for each subsequent element, it calculates the maximum product ending at that index as the maximum of the current element and the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous index. Finally, it returns the last element of the list, which is the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    max_ending_here = [0]*n\n    max_ending_here[0] = arr[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        max_ending_here[i] = max(arr[i], max_ending_here[i-1]*arr[i])\n    return max_ending_here[-1]\n\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\nThis function works by maintaining a list of the maximum product ending at each index.
