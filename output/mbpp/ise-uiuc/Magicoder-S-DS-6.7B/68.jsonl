Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to convert a string to a list of strings split on the space character. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert string_to_list(\"python programming\")==['python','programming']\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef string_to_list(s):\n    return s.split()\n\nassert string_to_list(\"python programming\")==['python','programming']\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `string_to_list` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of strings split on the space character.
