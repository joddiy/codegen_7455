{"task_id": "Mbpp/577", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number. This function uses the property that the last digit of the factorial of a number is the product of the last digit of the number and the last digit of the factorial of the number minus one.\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        last_digit = 1\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\n            last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10\n        return last_digit\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating from 2 to n (inclusive), multiplying the current last digit by the current number, and taking the modulo 10 of the result. This effectively keeps the last digit of the product, which is the last digit of the factorial of the current number.\n\nLet's test the function with the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass without any errors, indicating that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
