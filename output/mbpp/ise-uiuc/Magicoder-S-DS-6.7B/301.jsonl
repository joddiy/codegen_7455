The result is a new list where each element is the result of the division of the corresponding elements from the input lists.\n\nThe `assert` statement checks if the function `div_list` works correctly.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to divide two lists element wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    return [a / b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `div_list` that takes two lists as input.
