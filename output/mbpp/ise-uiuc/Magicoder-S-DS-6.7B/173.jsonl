Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n):\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        i *= 2\n    return i // 2\n\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\nThis function works by starting with 1 and doubling it in each iteration until it is greater than n.
