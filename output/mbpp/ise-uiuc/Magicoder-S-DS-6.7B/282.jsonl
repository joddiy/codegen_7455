Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_Swaps(bin1, bin2):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(bin1)):\n        if bin1[i] != bin2[i]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the two binary strings and counting the number of positions where the bits are different.
