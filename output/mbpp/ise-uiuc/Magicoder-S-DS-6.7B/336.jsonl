It then iterates over the list, checking each element. If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `val`, it returns the index of that element. If it doesn't find such an element, it returns the length of the list. This is because the value `val` would need to be inserted at the end of the list to maintain sorted order.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/data-structures-and-algorithms/python-data-structure-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, val):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] >= val:\n            return i\n    return len(arr)\n\n# Test the function\nassert left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `left_insertion` that takes a sorted list `arr` and a value `val`.
