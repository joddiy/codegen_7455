Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    return sum(i for i in set(lst) if lst.count(i) == 1)\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the list to a set to remove duplicates.
