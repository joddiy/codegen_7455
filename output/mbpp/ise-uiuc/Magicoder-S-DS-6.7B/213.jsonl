Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to join a list of multiple integers into a single integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef multiple_to_single(lst):\n    return int(''.join(map(str, lst)))\n\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting each integer in the list to a string using the `map` function, then joining them together into a single string using the `join` function.
