Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of fourth power of first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_num_sum(2) == 82\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):\n        sum += i**4\n    return sum\n\nassert odd_num_sum(2) == 82\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first `2n` odd numbers (since we are looking for the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd numbers), and adding the fourth power of each number to the sum.
