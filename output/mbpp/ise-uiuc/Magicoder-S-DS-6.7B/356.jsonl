If this conversion is successful, it checks if the string contains a decimal point. If it does, it checks if the part after the decimal point has more than 2 digits. If it does, it returns False, because a decimal number with a precision of 2 can't have more than 2 digits after the decimal point. If the string doesn't contain a decimal point, it just returns True, because a number without a decimal point can't have more than 2 digits after the decimal point. If the conversion to a float fails (because the string is not a valid number), it returns False.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether a given string is a decimal number with a precision of 2. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_decimal('123.11')==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a given string is a decimal number with a precision of 2:\n\n```python\ndef is_decimal(s):\n    try:\n        num = float(s)\n        if '.' in s:\n            decimal_part = s.split('.')[1]\n            if len(decimal_part) > 2:\n                return False\n        return True\n    except ValueError:\n        return False\n\nassert is_decimal('123.11')==True\n```\n\nThis function works by first trying to convert the string to a float.
