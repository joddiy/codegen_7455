Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to get the difference between two lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that uses list comprehension to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(li1, li2):\n    return [i for i in li1 if i not in li2]\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the first list (`li1`) and checking if it is not in the second list (`li2`).
