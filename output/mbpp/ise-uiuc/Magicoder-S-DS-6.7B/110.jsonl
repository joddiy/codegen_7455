Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the lateral surface area of a cylinder. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lateral_surface_cylinder(radius, height):\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius * height\n\nassert math.isclose(lateral_surface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis function takes the radius and height of a cylinder as input and returns the lateral surface area.
