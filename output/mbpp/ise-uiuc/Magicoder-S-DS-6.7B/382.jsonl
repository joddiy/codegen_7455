Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove tuples from the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes tuples from a given tuple:\n\n```python\ndef remove_nested(tup):\n    return tuple(x for x in tup if not isinstance(x, tuple))\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements in the tuple.
