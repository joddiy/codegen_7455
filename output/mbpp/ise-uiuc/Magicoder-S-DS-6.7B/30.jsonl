If it finds a pair where i^2 + j^2 equals n, it returns True.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a given number can be represented as the difference of two squares:\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    i = 0\n    while i * i <= n:\n        j = 0\n        while j * j <= n:\n            if i * i + j * j == n:\n                return True\n            j += 1\n        i += 1\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible pairs of non-negative integers i and j such that i^2 + j^2 <= n.
