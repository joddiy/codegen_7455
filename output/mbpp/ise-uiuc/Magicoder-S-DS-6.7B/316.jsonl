Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that calculates the wind chill index:\n\n```python\ndef wind_chill(velocity, temperature):\n    # Calculate the wind chill index\n    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215*temperature - 11.37*velocity**0.16 + 0.3965*temperature*velocity**0.16\n    # Round the wind chill index to the next integer\n    wind_chill_index = round(wind_chill_index)\n    return wind_chill_index\n\n# Test the function\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\nThis script uses the formula for calculating the wind chill index given by the National Weather Service (https://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/windchill/index.shtml).
