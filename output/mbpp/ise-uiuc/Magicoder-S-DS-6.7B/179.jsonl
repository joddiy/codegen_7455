Then it iterates through the string again, and returns the first character that has a count of 1. If no such character is found, it returns None.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert first_non_repeating_character(\"abcabc\") == None\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, as there are no non-repeating characters in the string \"abcabc\".", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the first non-repeated character in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_non_repeating_character(\"abcabc\") == None\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_character(string):\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    for char in string:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    return None\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a dictionary where the keys are the characters in the string and the values are the counts of those characters.
