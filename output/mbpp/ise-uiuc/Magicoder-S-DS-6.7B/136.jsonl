The `range` function is used to generate the sequence of odd numbers, and the `**` operator is used to square each number. The `assert` statement is used to check if the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 10\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):\n        sum += i**2\n    return sum\n\nassert square_Sum(2) == 10\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first `n` odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1) and adding the square of each number to a running total.
