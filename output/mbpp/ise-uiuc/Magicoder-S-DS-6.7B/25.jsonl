{"task_id": "Mbpp/67", "completion": "\nThe problem is asking to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. A Bell number is a sequence of numbers that arises in combinatorics and is defined by the following formula:\n\nB(n) = B(n-1) + (n-1) * B(n-2)\n\nThe base cases are:\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\n\nThe function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers can be implemented using dynamic programming. Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef bell_number(n):\n    # Initialize a 2D array to store the Bell numbers\n    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        # Explicitly fill for j = 0\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n        # Fill for remaining values of j\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + j*bell[i][j-1]\n    return bell[n][0]\n\n# Test the function\nassert bell_number(2) == 2\n```\n\nThis script first initializes a 2D array `bell` to store the Bell numbers. Then it fills the array using the formula `bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + j*bell[i][j-1]`. Finally, it returns the value of `bell[n][0]`, which is the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
