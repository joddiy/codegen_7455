For each pair of elements, it subtracts the second from the first. The result is a new list with the same length as the input lists, where each element is the result of the corresponding elements in the input lists being subtracted.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to subtract two lists element-wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    return [i - j for i, j in zip(list1, list2)]\n\nassert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension and the built-in `zip` function to iterate over two lists simultaneously.
