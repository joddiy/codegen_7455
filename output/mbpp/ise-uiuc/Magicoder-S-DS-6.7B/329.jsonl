Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function takes as input two lists [a_1,...,a_n], [b_1,...,b_n] and returns [a_1+b_1,...,a_n+b_n]. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_list([10,20,30],[15,25,35])==[25,45,65]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_list(list1, list2):\n    return [a + b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n\nassert sum_list([10,20,30],[15,25,35])==[25,45,65]\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `sum_list` takes two lists as input.
