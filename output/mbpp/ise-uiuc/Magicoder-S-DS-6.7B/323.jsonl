It first initializes a 2D array `dp` with the same size as the input matrix. Then it fills the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner, where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum total cost of a path that ends at cell `(i, j)`. Finally, it returns the average of the total cost of the path and the number of cells visited in the path.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nGiven a square matrix of size N*N given as a list of lists, where each cell is associated with a specific cost. A path is defined as a specific sequence of cells that starts from the top-left cell move only right or down and ends on bottom right cell. We want to find a path with the maximum average over all existing paths. Average is computed as total cost divided by the number of cells visited in the path. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]) == 5.2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef maxAverageOfPath(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + matrix[i][0]\n        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + matrix[0][i]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + matrix[i][j]\n    return dp[-1][-1] / (n*n)\n\nassert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]) == 5.2\n```\n\nThis script uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
