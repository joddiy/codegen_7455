Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove all elements from a given list present in another list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef remove_elements(lst1, lst2):\n    return [i for i in lst1 if i not in lst2]\n\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `remove_elements` that takes two lists as arguments.
