{"task_id": "Mbpp/14", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    \n    # Calculate the volume\n    volume = base_area * length\n    \n    return volume\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the area of the base of the triangular prism using the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 * base * height). Then it multiplies this area by the length of the prism to find the volume. The function is then tested with the provided assertion to ensure it works as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    \n    # Calculate the volume\n    volume = base_area * length\n    \n    return volume\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the area of the base of the triangular prism using the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 * base * height).
