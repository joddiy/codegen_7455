{"task_id": "Mbpp/70", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    lengths = [len(t) for t in tuples]\n    return len(set(lengths)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a list of the lengths of the tuples. It then checks if all the lengths are the same by converting this list to a set (which removes duplicates) and checking if the length of the set is 1. If the length of the set is 1, it means all the lengths are the same, so the function returns True. If the length of the set is not 1, it means there are different lengths, so the function returns False.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass without any errors, indicating that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find whether all the given tuples have equal length or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    lengths = [len(t) for t in tuples]\n    return len(set(lengths)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a list of the lengths of the tuples.
