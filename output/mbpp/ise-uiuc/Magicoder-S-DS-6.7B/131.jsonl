Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a / b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `division_elements` that takes two tuples as input.
