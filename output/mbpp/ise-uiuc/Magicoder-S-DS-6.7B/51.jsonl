Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(lst):\n    flattened_list = [item for sublist in lst for item in sublist]\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for item in flattened_list:\n        if item in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[item] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[item] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\nThis script first flattens the list of lists into a single list using a list comprehension.
