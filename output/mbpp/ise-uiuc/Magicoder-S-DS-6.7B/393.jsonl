Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(lst):\n    product = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        product *= num\n    return product % 2 == 0\n\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3]) == True\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `is_product_even` that takes a list of numbers as input.
