{"task_id": "Mbpp/610", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that removes the k'th element from a list:\n\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(lst, k):\n    return lst[:k] + lst[k+1:]\n\n# Test the function\nassert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThis function works by using Python's list slicing feature to create new lists that exclude the k'th element. The `lst[:k]` part creates a new list that includes all elements up to but not including the k'th element, and `lst[k+1:]` creates a new list that includes all elements after the k'th element. The `+` operator then concatenates these two lists together to form the final result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function which takes a list and returns a list with the same elements, but the k'th element removed. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes the k'th element from a list:\n\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(lst, k):\n    return lst[:k] + lst[k+1:]\n\n# Test the function\nassert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThis function works by using Python's list slicing feature to create new lists that exclude the k'th element.
