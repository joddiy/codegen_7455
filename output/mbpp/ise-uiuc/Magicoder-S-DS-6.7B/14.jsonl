{"task_id": "Mbpp/20", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a number that is the product of two consecutive integers.\n\n```python\ndef is_woodall(n):\n    i = 1\n    while i * (i + 1) <= n:\n        if n == i * (i + 1):\n            return True\n        i += 1\n    return False\n\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible pairs of consecutive integers (i and i + 1) and checking if the product of these two numbers is equal to the given number.
