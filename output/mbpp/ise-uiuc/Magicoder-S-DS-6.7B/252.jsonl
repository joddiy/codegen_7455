Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef union_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(sorted(set(t1 + t2)))\n\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `union_elements` takes two tuples as input.
