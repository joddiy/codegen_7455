Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to append the given list to the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add_lists(lst, tpl):\n    return tpl + tuple(lst)\n\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `add_lists` takes a list and a tuple as input.
