If the current tuple is equal to another tuple or its reverse, it increments the count. The reverse is obtained by slicing the tuple with `[::-1]`.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert count_bidirectional([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)]) == 3\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, as there are three bidirectional pairs in the list: `(5, 6)`, `(6, 5)`, and `(1, 2)`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
