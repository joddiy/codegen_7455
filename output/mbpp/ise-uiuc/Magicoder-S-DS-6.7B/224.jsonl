The function `text_match_wordz` takes a string `text` as an argument. The regular expression `\\b\\w*z\\w*\\b` is used to match any word that contains 'z'. The `\\b` is a word boundary, `\\w*` matches any word character (equal to [a-zA-Z0-9_]), and `z` is the character we are looking for. The function returns `True` if the word contains 'z' and `False` otherwise. The `assert` statement is used to test the function.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
