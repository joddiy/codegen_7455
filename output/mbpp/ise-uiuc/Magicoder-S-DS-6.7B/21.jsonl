Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuples):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for i in range(len(tuples)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(tuples)):\n            diff = abs(tuples[i][0] - tuples[j][0]) + abs(tuples[i][1] - tuples[j][1])\n            if diff > max_diff:\n                max_diff = diff\n    return max_diff\n\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all pairs of tuples in the list and calculating the absolute difference between the first elements of the tuples, and the second elements of the tuples.
