It iterates through each element in the array and checks if the number is greater than or equal to the current element. If it finds an element that is not greater than the number, it immediately returns `False`.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr, num):\n    for i in arr:\n        if num <= i:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `check_greater` takes an array `arr` and a number `num` as input.
