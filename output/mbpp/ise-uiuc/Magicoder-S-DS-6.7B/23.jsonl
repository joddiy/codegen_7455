Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to flatten a list and sum all of its elements. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_list_sum(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for element in lst:\n        if type(element) == list:\n            total += recursive_list_sum(element)\n        else:\n            total += element\n    return total\n\nassert recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]])==21\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as input.
