Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n):\n    sum = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 and i % 2 == 0:\n            sum += i\n        i += 1\n    return sum\n\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating from 1 to n (inclusive), and for each number i, it checks if i is a factor of n and if i is even.
