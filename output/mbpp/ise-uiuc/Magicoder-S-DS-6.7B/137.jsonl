{"task_id": "Mbpp/268", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the n'th star number:\n\n```python\ndef find_star_num(n):\n    return n*(n+1)*(n+2)//6\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_star_num(3) == 37\n```\n\nIn this function, we are using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the n'th star number. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)*(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. For our case, n is 3, a is 1, and l is 3. So, the formula becomes (3/2)*(1 + 3) = 37.\n\nThe `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is necessary because the formula involves integer division. If we used the `/` operator, the result would be a float.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
