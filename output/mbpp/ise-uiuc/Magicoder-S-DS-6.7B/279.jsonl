The `math.comb` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient. The assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_Of_product(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        sum += math.comb(n, i) * math.comb(n, i+1)\n    return sum\n\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\nThis function works by calculating the binomial coefficient (n choose i) for each i from 1 to n, and then multiplying these together and adding them to the sum.
