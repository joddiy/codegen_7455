Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the two integers that come after the first positive integer (the first positive integer will not always be at the beginning of the list). If there are no positive integers, return 0. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_after_first_positive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]) == 8\nassert sum_after_first_positive([1, 2, 3, -4, -5]) == 0\nassert sum_after_first_positive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 0\n```\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
