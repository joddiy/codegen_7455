{"task_id": "Mbpp/600", "completion": "\n```python\ndef is_Even(number):\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function is_Even takes a number as an argument and returns True if the number is even and False if the number is odd. The function uses the modulo operator (%) to check whether the number is even or odd. If the number is even, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.\n\n### Assertion:\nThe assertion checks that the function is_Even returns False for the number 1. This assertion will pass because the function returns False when the number is 1, which is an odd number.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function is_Even correctly checks whether a number is even or odd and returns the appropriate boolean value.\n\n### References:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_assert.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
