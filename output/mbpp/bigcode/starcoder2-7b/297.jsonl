The first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second element of each sublist.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a function that takes a list of lists and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a','m'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
