If it is, then it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the number itself. If it is divisible by any number, then it returns False. If it is not divisible by any number, then it returns True.\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if the given integer is a prime number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert prime_num(13)==True\n```\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
