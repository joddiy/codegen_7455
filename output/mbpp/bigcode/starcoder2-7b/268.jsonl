If it is, it iterates through the tuple and calls itself recursively on each item. If the item is an integer, it checks if it is even. If it is, it is added to the new tuple. If it is not, it is ignored. If the item is not an integer, it is ignored.\n\nThe function returns the new tuple.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns the correct tuple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function extract_even correctly extracts the even integers from the nested tuple.\n\n## Question 2\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
