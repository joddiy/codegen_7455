The function starts by adding the first element of the list to the result list. Then, it iterates over the remaining elements of the list and adds the element to the result list if it is not equal to the previous element. This ensures that consecutive duplicates are removed.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns the expected result for a given list.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `consecutive_duplicates` successfully removes consecutive duplicates from a list.\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]\n```\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
