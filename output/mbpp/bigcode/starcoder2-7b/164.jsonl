It then returns the product of this number with `2`, since there are two possible values for the last bit: `0` or `1`.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns the correct value for `n = 1`, which is `2`.\n\n### Output:\n```\nAssertionError\n```\n\n### Solution:\n```python\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 2 * count_binary_seq(n - 1)\n\nassert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `count_binary_seq` takes in an integer `n` and returns the number of binary sequences of length `2n` such that the sum of the first `n` bits is the same as the sum of the last `n` bits.\n\nThe base case is when `n == 0`, in which case there is only one binary sequence of length `2n` (the empty sequence).\n\nFor the recursive case, the function calls itself with `n - 1` to compute the number of binary sequences of length `2(n - 1)`.
