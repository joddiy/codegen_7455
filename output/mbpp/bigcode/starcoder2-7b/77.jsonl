Calculate the sum of the first row of the matrix.\n2. Calculate the sum of the second row of the matrix.\n3. Calculate the sum of the third row of the matrix.\n4. Calculate the sum of the fourth row of the matrix.\n5. Calculate the sum of the first column of the matrix.\n6. Calculate the sum of the second column of the matrix.\n7. Calculate the sum of the third column of the matrix.\n8. Calculate the sum of the fourth column of the matrix.\n9. Calculate the sum of the first diagonal of the matrix.\n10. Calculate the sum of the second diagonal of the matrix.\n11. If all the sums are equal, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nThe function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals of the matrix. It also uses the `==` operator to compare the sums.\n\nThe function returns `True` if all the sums are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\ndef magic_square_test(matrix):\n    # Your code here\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `magic_square_test` takes a matrix as an argument and returns `True` if the matrix is a magic square and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the following steps:\n1.
