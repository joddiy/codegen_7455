For example, if your input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(num):\n    count = 0\n    while num > 0:\n        count += num & 1\n        num >>= 1\n    return count\n```\n\n## Problem 2\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of the same length where the ith element is the product of all the numbers in the input list except for the ith element.
