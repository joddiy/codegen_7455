It iterates through the list and checks if each item in the list is equal to the element. If any item is not equal to the element, the function returns False. If all items are equal to the element, the function returns True.\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a list and returns the number of elements in the list that are equal to the given element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_element([\"green\", \"orange\", \"black\", \"white\"],'green')==1\n```\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
