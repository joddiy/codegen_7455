The function uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the list. The `join` method takes in a list of strings and returns a single string. The `join` method uses the `str` method to convert each integer in the list to a string. The `join` method uses the `int` method to convert the concatenated string to an integer.\n\n## Problem 2\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to join a list of multiple integers into a single integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
