It is based on the idea of sorting the elements of the array by using insertion sort, but it uses a gap sequence to determine the initial gap. The gap sequence is a sequence of integers that decreases monotonically to 1. The gap sequence is usually defined as:\n```python\ngap = len(arr) // 2\n```\nThe gap sequence is used to determine the initial gap. The gap sequence is used to determine the initial gap.
