{"task_id": "Mbpp/11", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s, ch):\n    first_occurrence = s.find(ch)\n    if first_occurrence != -1:\n        last_occurrence = s.rfind(ch)\n        return s[:first_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence+1:]\n    return s\n\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string using the `find` method. If the character is not found, `find` returns -1, and the function returns the original string. If the character is found, the function then finds the index of the last occurrence of the character in the string using the `rfind` method. The function then returns a new string that consists of all characters in the original string before the first occurrence and after the last occurrence of the character.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion is true and nothing happens. If the function returns a different result, the assertion is false and an `AssertionError` is raised.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s, ch):\n    first_occurrence = s.find(ch)\n    if first_occurrence != -1:\n        last_occurrence = s.rfind(ch)\n        return s[:first_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence+1:]\n    return s\n\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string using the `find` method.
