Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the maximum sum possible by using the given equation f(n) = max( (f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_max_sum(60) == 106\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that uses dynamic programming to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_max_sum(n):\n    # Initialize a list to store the maximum sum for each number up to n\n    max_sum = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    # For each number from 1 to n, calculate the maximum sum\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        max_sum[i] = max((max_sum[i//2] + max_sum[i//3] + max_sum[i//4] + max_sum[i//5]), i)\n\n    # Return the maximum sum for the given number n\n    return max_sum[n]\n\n# Test the function\nassert get_max_sum(60) == 106\n```\n\nThis script uses a list to store the maximum sum for each number up to n.
