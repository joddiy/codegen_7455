It checks if the number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the number is odd, it is included in the output list.\n\nThe `assert` statement checks if the function's output is equal to the expected output. If they are equal, the program continues running. If they are not equal, the program raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nYou can test the function with other lists as well. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(split([2,4,6,8,10,12]))  # Output: []\nprint(split([1,3,5,7,9,11]))  # Output: [1,3,5,7,9,11]\n```\n\nIn the first test, all numbers in the list are even, so the function returns an empty list.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef split(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]\n\nassert split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list.
