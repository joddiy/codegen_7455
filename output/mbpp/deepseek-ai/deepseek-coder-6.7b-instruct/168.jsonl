Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    products = []\n    for i in list1:\n        for j in list2:\n            products.append(i*j)\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    return products[:n]\n\nassert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]\n```\n\nThis script first creates a list of all possible products of one number from each list.
