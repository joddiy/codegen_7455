Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks whether all the characters in a given string are the same:\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s):\n    return len(set(s)) <= 1\n\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the string into a set, which automatically removes duplicate characters.
