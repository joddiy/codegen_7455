{"task_id": "Mbpp/748", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s):\n    return ' '.join(s.split())\n\nassert capital_words_spaces(\"Python\") == 'Python'\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method, which separates the string into words based on whitespace. The `join()` method then joins these words back together with spaces in between.\n\nHowever, this function doesn't handle the case where the input string starts with a capital letter. If you want to ensure that the first word is always capitalized, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s):\n    return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())\n\nassert capital_words_spaces(\"python\") == 'Python'\n```\n\nIn this version of the function, the `capitalize()` method is used to capitalize the first letter of each word before it is joined together with spaces.\n\nPlease note that the `split()` method in Python is case sensitive, so it will treat \"Python\" and \"python\" as two different strings. If you want to handle this case, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s):\n    return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())\n\nassert capital_words_spaces(\"python\") == 'Python'\n```\n\nIn this version of the function, the `split()` method is used with no arguments, which splits the string into words at each whitespace character.
