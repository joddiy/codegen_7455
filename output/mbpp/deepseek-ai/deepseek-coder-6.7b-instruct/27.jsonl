Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether a list contains the given sublist or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])==False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a list contains a given sublist:\n\n```python\ndef is_sublist(main_list, sublist):\n    return sublist in main_list\n\n# Test the function\nassert is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])==False\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's in operator to check if the sublist is in the main list.
