Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_reverse_pairs([\"julia\", \"best\", \"tseb\", \"for\", \"ailuj\"])== 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_reverse_pairs(lst):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            if lst[i] == lst[j][::-1]:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_reverse_pairs([\"julia\", \"best\", \"tseb\", \"for\", \"ailuj\"]) == 2\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each string in the list and comparing it to every other string in the list.
