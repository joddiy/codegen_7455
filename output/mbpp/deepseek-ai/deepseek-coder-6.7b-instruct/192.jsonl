Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if any value in one sequence exists in another sequence:\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    for i in seq1:\n        if i in seq2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the first sequence (`seq1`).
