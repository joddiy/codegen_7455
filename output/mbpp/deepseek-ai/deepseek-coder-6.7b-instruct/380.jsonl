Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to create a new tuple from the given string and list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert new_tuple([\"WEB\", \"is\"], \"best\") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef new_tuple(lst, string):\n    lst.append(string)\n    return tuple(lst)\n\nassert new_tuple([\"WEB\", \"is\"], \"best\") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')\n```\n\nThis function takes a list and a string as input.
