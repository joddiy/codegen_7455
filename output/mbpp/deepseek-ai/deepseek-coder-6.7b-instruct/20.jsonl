Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a simple Python function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef smallest_num(lst):\n    return min(lst)\n\nassert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.
