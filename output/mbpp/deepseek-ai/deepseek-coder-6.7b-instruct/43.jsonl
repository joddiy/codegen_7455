{"task_id": "Mbpp/89", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that fulfills the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef closest_num(n):\n    return n - 1\n\nassert closest_num(11) == 10\n```\n\nThis function simply subtracts 1 from the input number `n` and returns the result. This is the closest smaller number than `n`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input could be a negative number or zero, you would need to add additional logic to handle these cases.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle the case where `n` is already a single digit number (i.e., 0). If you want to handle this case, you can add additional logic to return `None` or a specific value when `n` is less than 10.\n\nHere is an example of how you might modify the function to handle these cases:\n\n```python\ndef closest_num(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return None\n    elif n < 10:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return n - 1\n\nassert closest_num(11) == 10\nassert closest_num(0) == None\nassert closest_num(-5) == None\nassert closest_num(9) == None\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the function, if `n` is less than 10, the function will return `None`.
