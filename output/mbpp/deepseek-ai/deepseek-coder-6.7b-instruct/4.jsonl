{"task_id": "Mbpp/7", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_char_long(s):\n    words = s.split()\n    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]\n    return long_words\n\nassert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `find_char_long` takes a string `s` as input. It splits the string into words using the `split` method, which splits the string at each space character. It then uses a list comprehension to create a list of words that have a length of 4 or more characters. Finally, it returns this list of words.\n\nThe assertion checks that the output of the function `find_char_long` on the string 'Please move back to stream' is a set containing the words 'Please', 'move', 'back', and 'stream'. If the assertion is true, nothing happens; if it's false, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n\nNote: This script assumes that words are separated by spaces and punctuation is not considered part of a word.\n\nIf you want to consider punctuation as part of a word, you can use a regular expression to split the string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_char_long(s):\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w{4,}\\b', s)\n    return words\n\nassert set(find_char_long('Please, move back to stream!!')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\n\nIn this version of the function, `re.findall` is used to find all words of length 4 or more in the string. The regular expression `\\b\\w{4,}\\b` matches any word of length 4 or more, where `\\b` is a word boundary, `\\w` matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`), and `{4,}` specifies that the preceding character (in this case, a word character) must appear 4 or more times.\n\nThis version of the assertion checks that the output of the function `find_char_long` on the string 'Please, move back to stream!!' is a set containing the words 'Please', 'move', 'back', and 'stream'.\n\nNote: This script assumes that words are separated by spaces and punctuation is considered part of a word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
