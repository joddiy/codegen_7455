{"task_id": "Mbpp/472", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not:\n\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst)+1))\n\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting the list and then comparing it to a list that contains the same numbers but in the range from the smallest to the largest number in the original list. If the two lists are identical, the original list contains consecutive numbers.\n\nThe `range` function is used to generate a list of numbers from the smallest to the largest number in the original list. The `min` and `max` functions are used to find the smallest and largest numbers in the original list, respectively. The `sorted` function is used to sort the original list.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns `True` when given the list `[1,2,3,4,5]`, then the assertion is true. If the function returns `False` or raises an error, then the assertion is false.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the list contains unique numbers. If the list can contain duplicate numbers, then the function will return `False` even if the numbers are consecutive.\n\nAlso, this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, then the function will raise a `ValueError`.\n\nIf you want to handle these cases, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return False\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst)+1))\n\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\nassert check_Consecutive([]) == False\n```\n\nIn this version of the function, if the list is empty, the function returns `False`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
