{"task_id": "Mbpp/618", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that divides two lists element-wise:\n\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    return [a / b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension and the built-in `zip` function to pair up the elements of the two lists. It then divides each pair of elements and returns the result as a new list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\nIf the assertion is true, then the function is working correctly.
