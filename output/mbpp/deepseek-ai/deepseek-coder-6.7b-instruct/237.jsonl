{"task_id": "Mbpp/471", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product = (product * num) % n\n    return product\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of numbers and a modulo number. It initializes a variable `product` to 1, then iterates over each number in the list. For each number, it multiplies the current `product` by the number and takes the modulo of the result with respect to `n`. This ensures that the product does not exceed the maximum value that can be held by an integer. The final product is then returned.\n\nThe assertion provided in the problem statement can be tested with the following code:\n\n```python\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) == 9\n```\n\nThis assertion checks if the function `find_remainder` returns 9 when given the list `[ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ]` and the modulo number 11. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion will pass and no output will be produced. If the function does not return the expected result, the assertion will fail and an AssertionError will be raised.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
