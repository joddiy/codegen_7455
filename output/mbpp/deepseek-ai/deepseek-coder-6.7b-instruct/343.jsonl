Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if the given tuple has any none value or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a simple Python function that checks if there is any None value in the given tuple:\n\n```python\ndef check_none(tup):\n    return None in tup\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is working correctly.\n\nPlease note that this function uses the `in` keyword, which checks if a value exists in a sequence (like a list or a tuple).
