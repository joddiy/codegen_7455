{"task_id": "Mbpp/725", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that uses regular expressions to extract the values between quotation marks:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_quotation(s):\n    return re.findall(r'\"([^\"]*)\"', s)\n\nassert extract_quotation('Cortex \"A53\" Based \"multi\" tasking \"Processor\"') == ['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']\n```\n\nIn this script, the `re.findall()` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern `\"([^\"]*)\"` in the given string. The pattern `\"([^\"]*)\"` matches any string that is enclosed in quotation marks. The `[^\"]*` part of the pattern matches any character that is not a quotation mark, zero or more times. The parentheses `()` are used to capture the matched characters, so they can be returned as a list.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion is true and nothing happens. If the function returns a different result, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n\nYou can run this script in a Python environment to test it.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain nested quotation marks. If the input string can contain nested quotation marks, you would need a more complex regular expression or a different approach.\n\nAlso, this script uses the `re` module, which is part of the standard Python library. If you don't have this module installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```\npip install regex\n```\n\nOr you can use the `re` module that comes with Python.\n\n```python\nimport re\n```\n\nIf you don't have pip installed, you can get it from https://pip.pypa.io/.\n\n```python\npip install pip\n```\n\nPlease note that the `pip` command should be run in a terminal or command prompt.
