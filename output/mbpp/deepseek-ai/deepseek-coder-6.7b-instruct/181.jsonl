{"task_id": "Mbpp/397", "completion": "\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the median of three numbers:\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a, b, c):\n    numbers = [a, b, c]\n    numbers.sort()\n    return numbers[1]\n\nassert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a list of the three numbers, then sorting that list. The median is then the second number in the sorted list, which is returned by the function.\n\nThe assertion checks that the median of the numbers 25, 55, and 65 is indeed 55.0.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the three input numbers are distinct. If they are not distinct, the median might not be the middle number.\n\nIf you want to handle the case where the numbers are not distinct, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a, b, c):\n    numbers = [a, b, c]\n    numbers.sort()\n    if a == b or b == c or a == c:\n        return numbers[1]\n    else:\n        return numbers[2]\n\nassert median_numbers(25,55,55)==55.0\n```\n\nIn this modified function, the function checks if any two of the numbers are equal. If they are, the function returns the middle number. Otherwise, it returns the third number.\n\nThis modified function will now correctly calculate the median of the numbers 25, 55, and 55 as 55.0.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
