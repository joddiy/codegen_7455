{"task_id": "Mbpp/772", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]\n    return ' '.join(words)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into a list of words, then filters out any words that have a length of `k`. It then joins the remaining words back into a string with spaces in between.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is working correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]\n    return ' '.join(words)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into a list of words, then filters out any words that have a length of `k`.
