{"task_id": "Mbpp/279", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function to find the nth decagonal number:\n\n```python\ndef is_num_decagonal(n):\n    return n*(7*n-5)//2\n\nassert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27\n```\n\nIn this function, the nth decagonal number is calculated using the formula n*(7n-5)/2. This formula is derived from the formula for the nth triangular number, which is n*(n+1)/2. The difference between the nth decagonal number and the nth triangular number is that the decagonal numbers are 7n-5 units apart.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function works correctly for the example given in the problem. The function should return 27 for n=3, which is the 3rd decagonal number.\n\nYou can test the function with different values of n to see if it works for other cases.\n\nNote: The function uses integer division (//) to ensure the result is an integer. This is important because decagonal numbers are integers.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth decagonal number.
