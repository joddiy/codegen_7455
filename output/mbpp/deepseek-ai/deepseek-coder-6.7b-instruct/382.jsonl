Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef remove_nested(tup):\n    return tuple(i for i in tup if not isinstance(i, tuple))\n\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `remove_nested` that takes a tuple as an argument.
