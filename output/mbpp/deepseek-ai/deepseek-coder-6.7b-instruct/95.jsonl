{"task_id": "Mbpp/165", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    return sum(1 for i in range(len(s)) if s[i] == chr(97 + i))\n\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `count_char_position` that takes a string `s` as input. We convert `s` to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive. Then we use a generator expression to create a sequence of 1s for each position in `s` where the character at that position is the same as the character at that position in the English alphabet (represented by the ASCII value 97 + the position). We sum up these 1s to get the total count.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks that the function works correctly for the example provided.\n\nPlease note that the function counts the characters at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet starting from 'a'. If you want to count from 'b', you can change the ASCII value in the `chr` function to 98.\n\nAlso, this function assumes that the string does not contain any non-alphabetic characters. If there might be non-alphabetic characters in the string, you should add a check to skip those positions.\n\nThis function is case-insensitive and does not consider non-alphabetic characters. If you want to consider only alphabetic characters, you can modify the function to only count the characters that pass a check for being alphabetic.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this script.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    return sum(1 for i in range(len(s)) if s[i] == chr(97 + i))\n\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `count_char_position` that takes a string `s` as input.
