Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef maximize_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(max(a, b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\nThis script works by using the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel.
