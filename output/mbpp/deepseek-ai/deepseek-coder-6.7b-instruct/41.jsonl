The `**` operator is used to unpack the dictionaries, effectively merging them. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the provided test case.\n\nNote: If there are duplicate keys in the input dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary in the argument list will be used in the merged dictionary. This is because dictionary keys are unique and the last value assigned to a key will be the one that is kept.\n\nIf you want to merge dictionaries in a way that values are lists, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):\n    merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}\n    for key, value in merged_dict.items():\n        if key in dict1 and key in dict2:\n            merged_dict[key] = [value, dict2[key]]\n        elif key in dict1 and key in dict3:\n            merged_dict[key] = [value, dict3[key]]\n        elif key in dict2 and key in dict3:\n            merged_dict[key] = [dict2[key], dict3[key]]\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\nThis version of the function will create a list of values for each key if the key is present in more than one dictionary.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the dictionaries do not have any circular references. If they do, a `RecursionError` will occur.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle the case where a key is present in more than two dictionaries. If that is a possibility, you would need to modify the function to handle that case.\n\nLastly, this function does not handle the case where a key is present in all three dictionaries. If that is a possibility, you would need to modify the function to handle that case.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
