If the list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it multiplies all the numbers in the list together and divides by the length of the list to get the average. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result is close to -67.2 within a relative tolerance of 0.001.\n\nYou can run this script to check if it satisfies the assertion.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_num(lst):\n    if len(lst) == 0:\n        return 0\n    product = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        product *= num\n    return product / len(lst)\n\nimport math\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `multiply_num` that takes a list of numbers as input.
