The XOR operation will give a number where all the bits that are set in either of the numbers but not both are set. Then, it counts the number of set bits in this result. If the count is exactly 1, then the numbers differ at one bit position. Otherwise, they differ at more than one bit position or not at all.\n\nIn the test case, `13` and `9` differ at one bit position (the 2nd bit from the right).
