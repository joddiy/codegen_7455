If it can, the function returns `True`. If no such `i` and `j` are found, the function returns `False`.\n\nThe function uses a break statement to exit the inner loop as soon as `i^2` is greater than `n`, which is a performance optimization.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the code checks if the function works correctly for the given example.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a given number can be represented as the difference of two squares:\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    # Iterate from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Check if n can be represented as difference of two squares\n        if n < i*i:\n            break\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            if n == (i*i - j*j):\n                return True\n    return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible values of `i` and `j`, and checking if `n` can be represented as `i^2 - j^2`.
