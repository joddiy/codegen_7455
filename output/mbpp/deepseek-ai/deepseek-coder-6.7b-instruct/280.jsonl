Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")==('216.8.94.196')\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes leading zeroes from an IP address:\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip):\n    return '.'.join(str(int(i)) for i in ip.split('.'))\n\n# Test the function\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\") == '216.8.94.196'\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into a list of its components (using the `split('.')` method), converting each component to an integer (using the `int()` function), and then joining the components back together into a string with `join('.')`.
