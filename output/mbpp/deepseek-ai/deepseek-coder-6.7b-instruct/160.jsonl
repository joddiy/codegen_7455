{"task_id": "Mbpp/295", "completion": "\nSure, here is a Python function that calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef sum_div(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n\nassert sum_div(8) == 15\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by the current number (i.e., if `n` modulo the current number equals 0). If `n` is divisible by the current number, the current number is added to the sum. The function finally returns the sum of all divisors.\n\nThe assertion `assert sum_div(8) == 15` checks if the function works correctly for the number 8. If the function returns 15, the assertion is true and the test passes. If the function returns a different number, the assertion is false and the test fails, indicating that the function is not working correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
