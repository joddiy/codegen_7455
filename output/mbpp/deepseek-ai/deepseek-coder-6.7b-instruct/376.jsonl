Inside the function, we use list comprehension to separate the even and odd numbers from the list. The even numbers are obtained by checking if the remainder of the division of each number by 2 is 0, while the odd numbers are obtained by checking if the remainder of the division of each number by 2 is not 0.\n\nFinally, we return the product of the first even and odd number in the list.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion will pass, otherwise it will raise an AssertionError.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the list will always contain at least one even and one odd number. If this is not the case, you may want to add some error checking to handle this situation.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(lst):\n    even = [i for i in lst if i % 2 == 0]\n    odd = [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]\n    return even[0] * odd[0]\n\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]) == 4\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define a function `mul_even_odd` that takes a list `lst` as input.
