Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l, r):\n    return sum(i for i in range(l, r+1) if i % 2 != 0)\n\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\nThis function works by using a generator expression to iterate over all numbers in the range from l to r (inclusive), and only includes those numbers that are odd (i.e., those for which the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0).
