{"task_id": "Mbpp/19", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))\n\nassert test_duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]) == False\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the input list to a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. If the length of the list and the set are not equal, it means that there are duplicate elements in the list. Therefore, the function returns True. If the length of the list and the set are equal, it means that all elements in the list are unique, so the function returns False.\n\nThe assert statement is used to test the function. It checks if the function returns False for the input [1,2,3,4,5], which is expected because there are no duplicate elements in the list. If the function returns something other than False, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
