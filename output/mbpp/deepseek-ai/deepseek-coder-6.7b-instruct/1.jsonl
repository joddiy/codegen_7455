If the number is greater than 3 and is divisible by 2 or 3, it is also not a prime number. Then it checks if the number is divisible by any number in the form of 6k \u00b1 1, up to the square root of the number. If it is, then the number is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then the number is a prime number.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the code checks if the function works correctly.
