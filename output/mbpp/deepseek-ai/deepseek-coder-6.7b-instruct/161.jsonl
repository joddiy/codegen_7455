{"task_id": "Mbpp/296", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses the Merge Sort algorithm to count the number of inversions in an array. The Merge Sort algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts them separately and then merges them. The inversion count is increased whenever an element from the first half array is greater than an element from the second half array.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr, 0\n\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half, left_inv = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n    right_half, right_inv = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n    merged_arr, merge_inv = merge(left_half, right_half)\n\n    return merged_arr, left_inv + right_inv + merge_inv\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    merged = []\n    inversions = 0\n    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:\n        if left[0] <= right[0]:\n            merged.append(left.pop(0))\n        else:\n            merged.append(right.pop(0))\n            inversions += len(left)\n    merged += left\n    merged += right\n    return merged, inversions\n\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr):\n    _, inversions = merge_sort(arr)\n    return inversions\n\nassert get_Inv_Count([1,20,6,4,5]) == 5\n```\n\nIn this code, the `merge_sort` function is a recursive function that splits the array into two halves until it can no longer be split. The `merge` function is used to merge the two halves back together, while counting the number of inversions. The `get_Inv_Count` function is the main function that calls `merge_sort` and returns the number of inversions.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the use of the Merge Sort algorithm.\n\nThe `assert` statement checks if the function `get_Inv_Count` returns the correct number of inversions for the given array.\n\nPlease note that the `pop(0)` operation in Python has a time complexity of O(n), so this code may not be the most efficient solution for large arrays.\n\nIf you need a more efficient solution, you might want to consider using a data structure that supports efficient removal of elements from the beginning of the array, such as a deque from the collections module in Python.\n\nAlso, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says \"count inversions in an array\", but it doesn't specify what an inversion is. In the provided solution, an inversion is defined as a pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second. If the definition of an inversion is different, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
