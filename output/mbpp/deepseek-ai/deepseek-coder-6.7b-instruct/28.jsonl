It then iterates over each tuple in the list, checking if its length is equal to the length of the first tuple. If it finds a tuple that is not the same length as the first, it returns False. If it goes through all the tuples without finding one that is not the same length, it returns True.\n\nYou can test this function with your assertion:\n\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, because both tuples in the list have the same length (3).\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find whether all the given tuples have equal length or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    length = len(tuples[0])\n    for tup in tuples:\n        if len(tup) != length:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function works by first getting the length of the first tuple in the list.
