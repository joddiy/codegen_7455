{"task_id": "Mbpp/234", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length):\n    return side_length ** 3\n\nassert volume_cube(3) == 27\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the exponentiation operator (`**`) to raise the side length to the power of 3, which is the formula for calculating the volume of a cube. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the correct volume for a side length of 3 (which it should, since 3 ** 3 == 27), the assertion will pass. If the function returns a different value, the assertion will fail, and an error will be raised.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
