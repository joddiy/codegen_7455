Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add_lists(lst, tpl):\n    return tpl + tuple(lst)\n\n# Test the function\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\n```\n\nThis function takes a list and a tuple as input.
