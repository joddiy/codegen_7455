It returns a new tuple that is the result of concatenating the original tuple and the dictionary. The `assert` statement checks whether the function works correctly.\n\nNote: In Python, tuples are immutable, so we can't add an element to a tuple directly. Instead, we create a new tuple that includes the original tuple and the dictionary.\n\nThis script will pass the assertion if the function works correctly.\n\nPlease note that the order of the elements in the tuple is important. The dictionary is added as the last element of the tuple.\n\nAlso, the dictionary is added as a single element in the tuple, not as separate elements. If you want the dictionary to be added as separate elements, you would need to add each item of the dictionary to the tuple separately.\n\nHere is a modified version of the script that adds the dictionary's items to the tuple separately:\n\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dic):\n    return tup + tuple(dic.items())\n\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, ('MSAM', 1), ('is', 2), ('best', 3))\n```\n\nIn this version, `tuple(dic.items())` creates a tuple of the dictionary's items.
