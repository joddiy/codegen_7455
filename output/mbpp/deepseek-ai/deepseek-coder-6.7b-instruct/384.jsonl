{"task_id": "Mbpp/793", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses the built-in `list.index()` method to find the last occurrence of an element in a list.\n\n```python\ndef last(lst, elm):\n    try:\n        return len(lst) - 1 - lst[::-1].index(elm)\n    except ValueError:\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function works by reversing the list and finding the index of the element in the reversed list. The index in the reversed list is the distance from the end of the original list, so subtracting this from the length of the original list gives the position of the element in the original list.\n\nThe `try`/`except` block is used to handle the case where the element is not in the list, in which case `list.index()` raises a `ValueError`. In this case, the function returns `None`.\n\nThe assertion `assert last([1,2,3],1) == 0` is satisfied by this function.\n\n```python\nassert last([1,2,3],1) == 0\n```\n\nThis assertion means that the last position of the number 1 in the list [1,2,3] is 0 (since Python uses zero-based indexing).\n\nPlease note that this function will return the last occurrence of the element in the original order of the list, not the last occurrence in the sorted order of the list. If you want to find the last occurrence in the sorted order of the list, you would need to sort the list first, which would change the original order of the elements.\n\n```python\ndef last_sorted(lst, elm):\n    try:\n        return len(lst) - 1 - sorted(lst, reverse=True).index(elm)\n    except ValueError:\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function will return the last occurrence of the element in the sorted order of the list. For example, `last_sorted([3,2,1],1)` will return `2`.\n\n```python\nassert last_sorted([3,2,1],1) == 2\n```\n\nThis assertion means that the last position of the number 1 in the list [3,2,1] is 2 (since Python uses zero-based indexing).\n\nPlease note that the `list.index()` method has a time complexity of O(n), so this function could be slow if the list is very large. If you need to find the last occurrence of an element many times, it would be more efficient to create a dictionary that maps each element to its last occurrence in the list.\n\n```python\ndef last_positions(lst):\n    return {elm: i for i, elm in enumerate(lst[::-1])}\n\npositions = last_positions([1,2,3,1,2,3,1])\nassert positions[1] == 6\nassert positions[2] == 5\nassert positions[3] == 4\n```\n\nThis function creates a dictionary that maps each element to its last occurrence in the list. The keys of the dictionary are the elements in the list, and the values are the indices of the elements in the reversed list. The last occurrence of an element is the index in the reversed list, which is the length of the list minus the index in the original list minus one.\n\nThis function is faster than the previous functions for finding the last occurrence of an element in a list, especially if the list is very large. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.\n\n```python\nassert last_positions([1,2,3,1,2,3,1])[1] == 6\nassert last_positions([1,2,3,1,2,3,1])[2] == 5\nassert last_positions([1,2,3,1,2,3,1])[3] == 4\n```\n\nThis assertion means that the last position of the number 1 in the list [1,2,3,1,2,3,1] is 6 (since Python uses zero-based indexing), the last position of the number 2 in the list is 5", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
