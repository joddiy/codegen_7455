{"task_id": "Mbpp/803", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if a given number is a perfect square:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    root = math.sqrt(n)\n    return n == int(root + 0.5) ** 2\n\nassert not is_perfect_square(10)\n```\n\nThis function works by taking the square root of the number, rounding it to the nearest integer, and then squaring the result. If the original number is a perfect square, this will be equal to the original number.\n\nIn the assertion, we are checking if `is_perfect_square(10)` returns `False`, which is the expected result since 10 is not a perfect square.\n\nThis function will work for all non-negative integers. If you want to check if a number is a perfect square in a different context, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
