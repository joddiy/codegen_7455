{"task_id": "Mbpp/292", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find(num1, num2):\n    return num1 // num2\n\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\nIn this function, the \"//\" operator is used to perform integer division, which rounds down the result to the nearest integer.\n\nThis function will return the integer part of the division of num1 by num2. For example, if num1 is 10 and num2 is 3, the function will return 3 because 10 divided by 3 equals 3.33, and the \"//\" operator rounds down to 3.\n\nThe assert statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the expected result (3 in this case), the assert statement does nothing. If the function returns a different result, an AssertionError will be raised. This is a way to catch errors in your code.\n\nYou can test the function with other pairs of numbers to make sure it works as expected. For example:\n\n```python\nassert find(15,4) == 3\nassert find(123,10) == 12\nassert find(100,5) == 20\n```\n\nThese tests should pass without raising an AssertionError.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
