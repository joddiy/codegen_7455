{"task_id": "Mbpp/640", "completion": "\nSure, here is a simple Python function that uses the built-in `re` module to remove the parenthesis and what is inbetween them from a string.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef remove_parenthesis(s):\n    return re.sub(r'\\s?\\(.+?\\)', '', s)\n\nassert remove_parenthesis(\"python (chrome)\") == \"python\"\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match and remove the parenthesis and what is inbetween them. The `re.sub` function is used to replace the matched pattern with an empty string. The `\\s?\\(.+?\\)` pattern matches any parenthesis and what is inbetween them, including an optional space before the parenthesis.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input is a string and not a list. If you pass a list to the function, it will raise a TypeError. If you want to handle lists as well, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef remove_parenthesis(lst):\n    return [re.sub(r'\\s?\\(.+?\\)', '', s) for s in lst]\n\nassert remove_parenthesis([\"python (chrome)\"]) == [\"python\"]\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses a list comprehension to apply the regular expression to each string in the list.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
