Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the lateral surface area of a cone given radius r and the height h. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cone(5,12)==204.20352248333654\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lateralsurface_cone(r, h):\n    return math.pi * r * math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)\n\nassert lateralsurface_cone(5,12)==204.20352248333654\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the lateral surface area of a cone, which is \u03c0 * r * sqrt(r^2 + h^2), where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cone.
