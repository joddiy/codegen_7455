{"task_id": "Mbpp/798", "completion": "\nHere is a simple Python function that uses the built-in `sum` function to find the sum of an array:\n\n```python\ndef _sum(arr):\n    return sum(arr)\n\nassert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6\n```\n\nThis function works by taking an array as input and returning the sum of its elements. The `assert` statement checks that the function works correctly for the given example.\n\nIf you run this code, it should pass the assertion without any output, indicating that the function is working correctly.\n\nIf you want to use a loop instead of the built-in `sum` function, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef _sum(arr):\n    total = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        total += num\n    return total\n\nassert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6\n```\n\nThis code works by initializing a variable `total` to 0, then adding each number in the array to `total`. The result is then returned.\n\nBoth of these functions will work for any array of numbers, not just the example in the assertion.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
