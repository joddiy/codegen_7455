Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add_tuple(lst, tup):\n    return lst + list(tup)\n\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `add_tuple` that takes a list and a tuple as arguments.
