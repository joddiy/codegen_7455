{"task_id": "Mbpp/581", "completion": "\nSure, here is a Python function that calculates the surface area of a square pyramid:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef surface_Area(base_edge, height):\n    # The formula for the surface area of a square pyramid is:\n    # Area = 1/2 * base_edge^2 + base_edge * sqrt((base_edge/2)^2 + height^2)\n    return 0.5 * base_edge**2 + base_edge * math.sqrt((base_edge/2)**2 + height**2)\n\n# Test the function\nassert surface_Area(3,4) == 33\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the surface area of a square pyramid, which is `1/2 * base_edge^2 + base_edge * sqrt((base_edge/2)^2 + height^2)`. The `math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root. The function is tested with the assertion `assert surface_Area(3,4) == 33`.\n\nPlease note that the formula used here assumes that the base of the pyramid is a square. If the base is not square, you would need to use a different formula.\n\nAlso, the formula assumes that the height of the pyramid is the distance from the base of the pyramid to the apex (i.e., the height of the pyramid). If the height is the distance from the center of the base of the pyramid to the apex, you would need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
