{"task_id": "Mbpp/641", "completion": "\nA nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nine-sided polygon, a nonagon. The nth nonagonal number can be found using the formula: n(7n-5)/2.\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the nth nonagonal number:\n\n```python\ndef nth_nonagonal(n):\n    return n*(7*n-5)//2\n\nassert nth_nonagonal(10) == 325\n```\n\nIn this function, the input `n` is the position of the nonagonal number in the sequence. The function uses the formula to calculate and return the nth nonagonal number. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the provided input and output.\n\nThe `//` operator is used for division to ensure that the result is an integer, as nonagonal numbers are always integers.\n\nThis function can be used to find any nonagonal number in the sequence by providing the position as the argument. For example, `nth_nonagonal(5)` would return `21`, which is the fifth nonagonal number.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth nonagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_nonagonal(10) == 325\n```\n\n### Response:\nA nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nine-sided polygon, a nonagon.
