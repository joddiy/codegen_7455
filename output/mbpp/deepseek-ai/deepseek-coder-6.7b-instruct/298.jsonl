The assertion checks that the function works correctly for the given example.\n\nYou can run this script in a Python environment to test it.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef cummulative_sum(tuples):\n    total = 0\n    for t in tuples:\n        total += sum(t)\n    return total\n\nassert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `cummulative_sum` takes a list of tuples as input.
