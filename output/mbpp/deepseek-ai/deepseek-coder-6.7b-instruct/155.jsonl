Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        sum += i*2**2\n    return sum\n\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first n even natural numbers (which are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n), squaring each one, and adding it to a running total.
