Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of positive numbers in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pos_count([1,-2,3,-4]) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of positive numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef pos_count(lst):\n    count = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num > 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert pos_count([1,-2,3,-4]) == 2\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each number in the list.
