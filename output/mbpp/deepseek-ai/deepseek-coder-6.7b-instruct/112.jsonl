{"task_id": "Mbpp/235", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that sets all even bits of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    binary = bin(n)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    binary = '0' + binary  # Add a leading zero to make the indices start from 1\n    binary = list(binary)  # Convert to list for easy manipulation\n\n    for i in range(1, len(binary), 2):  # Start from the second bit (index 1)\n        binary[i] = '1'  # Set the even bits to 1\n\n    return int(''.join(binary), 2)  # Convert back to integer and return\n\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the given number to binary, then iterating over the binary representation and setting the even bits to 1. The result is then converted back to an integer and returned.\n\nPlease note that the indexing in Python starts from 0, so we start from the second bit (index 1) and set every second bit to 1.\n\nAlso, the binary representation of a number starts from the least significant bit, so we add a leading zero to make the indices start from 1.\n\nFinally, the function uses the `bin` function to convert the number to binary, and the `int` function to convert the binary back to an integer. The `bin` function returns a string that starts with '0b', so we remove this prefix with `[2:]`.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks that the function works correctly for the example given in the problem statement.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
