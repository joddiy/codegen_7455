{"task_id": "Mbpp/266", "completion": "\nSure, here is a simple Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    return 4 * side_length ** 2\n\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100\n```\n\nThis function works by taking the side length of the cube as input, squaring it (to get the area of one face), and then multiplying by 4 (since there are 4 faces of equal area).\n\nYou can test this function with other inputs as well. For example, `lateralsurface_cube(10)` would return `400`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a simple Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length:\n\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    return 4 * side_length ** 2\n\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100\n```\n\nThis function works by taking the side length of the cube as input, squaring it (to get the area of one face), and then multiplying by 4 (since there are 4 faces of equal area).\n\nYou can test this function with other inputs as well.
