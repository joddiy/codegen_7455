Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert rear_extract([(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]) == [21, 20, 19]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef rear_extract(lst):\n    return [i[-1] for i in lst]\n\nassert rear_extract([(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]) == [21, 20, 19]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `rear_extract` that takes a list of tuples as input.
