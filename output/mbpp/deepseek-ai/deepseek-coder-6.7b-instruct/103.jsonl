It first calculates the threshold for being a majority element, which is `n // 2`. It then finds the first occurrence of `elm` in `arr` and checks if the number of occurrences of `elm` in the subarray starting from the first occurrence and ending at the threshold is greater than the threshold.

(The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_majority(arr, n, elm):\n    # calculate the threshold\n    threshold = n // 2\n\n    # find the first occurrence of the element\n    first_occurrence = arr.index(elm)\n\n    # check if the element is the majority\n    return arr[first_occurrence:first_occurrence + threshold].count(elm) > threshold\n\n# test the function\nassert is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3) == True\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `is_majority` that takes a sorted array `arr`, its length `n`, and an element `elm`.
