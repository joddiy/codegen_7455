The function returns the counter, which represents the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple.\n\nThe assertion checks whether the function works correctly.

If you want to count the elements in the tuples, you should modify the function to check if the element is a tuple and then count the elements in it.\n\nHere is the modified function:\n\n```python\ndef count_elements_in_tuples(tup):\n    count = 0\n    for i in tup:\n        if isinstance(i, tuple):\n            count += len(i)\n        else:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_elements_in_tuples((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == 5\n```\n\nIn this modified function, if an element is a tuple, it counts the number of elements in it.
