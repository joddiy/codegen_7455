{"task_id": "Mbpp/171", "completion": "\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides:\n\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    return 5 * side_length\n\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\nIn this function, we take the side length of the pentagon as an argument and return the result of multiplying the side length by 5 (since a pentagon has 5 sides). The assert statement is used to test the function with the provided example.\n\nYou can use this function by calling `perimeter_pentagon(side_length)`, replacing `side_length` with the length of the side of the pentagon you want to calculate the perimeter for.\n\nFor example, `perimeter_pentagon(5)` would return `25`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides:\n\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    return 5 * side_length\n\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\nIn this function, we take the side length of the pentagon as an argument and return the result of multiplying the side length by 5 (since a pentagon has 5 sides).
