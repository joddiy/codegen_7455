It checks if the lists have the same length. If they do, it uses the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from the two lists together. It then counts the number of pairs where the elements are the same by using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. The result is the number of indices where the lists have the same values.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly.

Write a function to count indices where the lists have the same values. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    assert len(list1) == len(list2), \"Lists must be of the same length\"\n    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(list1, list2) if a == b)\n\nassert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4\n```\n\nIn this script, the `count_same_pair` function takes two lists as input.
