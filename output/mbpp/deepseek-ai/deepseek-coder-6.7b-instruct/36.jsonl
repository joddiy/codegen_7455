The `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the calculated volume is close to the expected value, within a relative tolerance of 0.001.\n\nYou can run this script to check if the function works correctly. If the function is implemented correctly, it will not output anything, indicating that all assertions passed. If there is an assertion error, it will raise an `AssertionError`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the volume of a sphere. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a Python function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_sphere(radius):\n    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
