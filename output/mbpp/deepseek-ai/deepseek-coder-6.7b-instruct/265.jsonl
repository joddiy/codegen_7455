{"task_id": "Mbpp/577", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the last digit of a factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    last_digit = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        last_digit *= i\n        while last_digit % 10 == 0:\n            last_digit //= 10\n        last_digit %= 10\n    return last_digit\n\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\nThis function works by iteratively multiplying each number from 1 to `n` with the current `last_digit`. If the `last_digit` is a multiple of 10, it is divided by 10 until it is no longer a multiple of 10. Then, the `last_digit` is taken modulo 10 to get the last digit. This process is repeated until all numbers from 1 to `n` have been multiplied.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the code checks that the function works correctly for the given example.\n\nNote: This function may not work correctly for very large numbers due to the limitations of Python's integer type.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the `last_digit` variable and iterates over the range from 1 to `n`.\n\nPlease note that this function will not work correctly for negative numbers as factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\nAlso, this function will not work correctly for very large numbers due to the limitations of Python's integer type. The largest number that can be handled by Python's integer type is determined by the available memory.\n\nIf you need to calculate the factorial of very large numbers, you should use a library that supports arbitrary precision arithmetic, such as the `mpmath` library in Python.\n\nHere is how you can use `mpmath` to calculate the factorial:\n\n```python\nfrom mpmath import factorial\n\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    return int(str(factorial(n))[-1])\n\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses `mpmath.factorial` to calculate the factorial, which supports very large numbers. The last digit of the factorial is then obtained by converting the factorial to a string and taking the last character of the string. This is converted back to an integer before being returned.\n\nPlease note that the `mpmath` library is not included in the standard Python library, so you will need to install it separately using pip:\n\n```\npip install mpmath\n```\n\nThis version of the function has the same time and space complexity as the previous version, but it can handle very large numbers.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
