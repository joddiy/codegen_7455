If the number of different bits is odd, it's impossible to convert one binary number to another by swapping bits, so the function returns -1. If the number of different bits is even, the script then counts the number of groups of 2 different bits. If the number of groups of 2 different bits is odd, it's impossible to convert one binary number to another by swapping groups of 2 bits, so the function returns -1. If the number of groups of 2 different bits is even, the script calculates the number of swaps required by dividing the number of different bits by 2 and the number of groups of 2 different bits by 2, and returns this value.\n\nThis script assumes that the two binary numbers have the same length. If they don't, the script can be modified to pad the shorter number with zeros on the left until they have the same length.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_Swaps(s1, s2):\n    # Count the number of different bits\n    diff = sum([el1 != el2 for el1, el2 in zip(s1, s2)])\n    \n    # If the number of different bits is odd, return -1\n    if diff % 2 != 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Count the number of groups of 2 different bits\n    groups = sum([el1 == el2 for el1, el2 in zip(s1, s2)])\n    \n    # If the number of groups of 2 different bits is odd, return -1\n    if groups % 2 != 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of swaps\n    swaps = diff // 2 + groups // 2\n    \n    return swaps\n\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\nThis script works by first counting the number of different bits between the two binary numbers.
