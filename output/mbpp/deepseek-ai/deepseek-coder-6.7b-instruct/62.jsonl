{"task_id": "Mbpp/109", "completion": "\nHere is a Python solution for the problem. The idea is to rotate the binary string and count the number of odd values.\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\n    binary_string = binary_string * 2\n    odd_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(binary_string) // 2):\n        binary = binary_string[i:i + rotations]\n        odd_count += bin(int(binary, 2)).count('1') % 2\n    return odd_count\n\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a binary string that is twice the length of the original string. This is done to simulate the rotation of the binary string. Then, we iterate over the binary string and for each rotation, we convert the substring to an integer and count the number of 1's in its binary representation. If the count is odd, we increment the `odd_count`. Finally, we return the `odd_count`.\n\nThe assertion at the end tests the function with the given example.\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that the input binary string is a string of 0's and 1's. If the input can contain other characters, you may need to add error checking to handle this.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution for the problem.
