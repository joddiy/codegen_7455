{"task_id": "Mbpp/167", "completion": "\nSure, here is a Python function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2**(n-1).bit_length()\n\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\nThis function uses the `bit_length()` method of Python integers. This method returns the number of bits needed to represent the integer in binary, which is equivalent to the power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the integer.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 5, `n-1` is 4, and `2**(4)` is 16. But since 16 is not greater than or equal to 5, we need to find the next power of 2. The next power of 2 greater than 5 is 8, which is `2**3`. So, the function returns 8.\n\nPlease note that this function will return 1 for negative numbers and 0, as they are not considered powers of 2.\n\nYou can test this function with other values as well:\n\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(1) == 1\nassert next_power_of_2(2) == 2\nassert next_power_of_2(3) == 4\nassert next_power_of_2(4) == 4\nassert next_power_of_2(5) == 8\nassert next_power_of_2(6) == 8\nassert next_power_of_2(7) == 8\nassert next_power_of_2(8) == 8\nassert next_power_of_2(9) == 16\n```\n\nThis function should work for any integer `n`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
