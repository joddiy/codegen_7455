The `cmath.cos` and `cmath.sin` functions are used to calculate the x and y coordinates respectively. The `.real` attribute is used to get the real part of the complex number. The assertion checks if the function works correctly.\n\nPlease note that the assertion is checking for a specific output format, which might not be the most practical way to test the function.
