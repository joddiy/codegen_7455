Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python solution using dynamic programming:\n\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    dp = [[0]*(m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        dp[1][i] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, m+1):\n            for k in range(1, j):\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]\n    return sum(dp[n])\n\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\nIn this solution, `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` where the last element is `j`.
