{"task_id": "Mbpp/579", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(set(t1) ^ set(t2))\n\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nIn this function, the `^` operator is used to find the symmetric difference of two sets. The symmetric difference of two sets is a set of elements that are in either of the sets and not in their intersection.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the expected result, the `assert` statement does nothing. If the function does not return the expected result, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nPlease note that the order of elements in the result tuple may vary because sets in Python are unordered.\n\nIf you want to preserve the original order of elements, you can use a list comprehension with an `if` condition to check if an element is in one of the tuples but not in the other:\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(x for x in t1 if x not in t2) + tuple(x for x in t2 if x not in t1)\n\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a tuple of elements that are in `t1` but not in `t2`, and then creating a tuple of elements that are in `t2` but not in `t1`. The two tuples are then concatenated to form the final result.\n\nPlease note that this function will not work correctly if the same element appears multiple times in either tuple. If you need to handle this case, you will need to use a different approach.\n\nAlso, please note that the order of elements in the result tuple will be the same as they appear in the original tuples.\n\nIf you want to preserve the order of elements in the original tuples, you can use a list comprehension with an `if` condition to check if an element is in one of the tuples but not in the other:\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(x for x in t1 if x not in t2) + tuple(x for x in t2 if x not in t1)\n\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a tuple of elements that are in `t1` but not in `t2`, and then creating a tuple of elements that are in `t2` but not in `t1`.
