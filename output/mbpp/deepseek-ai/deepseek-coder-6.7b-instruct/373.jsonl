{"task_id": "Mbpp/781", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if the count of divisors of a number is even:\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count % 2 == 0\n\nassert count_divisors(10)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by the current number (i.e., if `n` modulo the current number equals 0). If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it checks if the count of divisors is even by checking if the count modulo 2 equals 0. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the script checks if the function works correctly for the number 10. If the function returns `True`, the assertion is satisfied; otherwise, it raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nPlease note that this function counts 1 and `n` as divisors, so the count of divisors of a number `n` is always odd if `n` is not a perfect square.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
