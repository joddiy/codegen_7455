{"task_id": "Mbpp/603", "completion": "\nA Lucas number is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 2 and 1. The sequence starts 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, and so on.\n\nHere is a Python function that generates Lucas numbers up to a given limit:\n\n```python\ndef get_lucas(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [2]\n    if n == 2:\n        return [2, 1]\n\n    lucas = [2, 1]\n    while lucas[-1] + lucas[-2] <= n:\n        lucas.append(lucas[-1] + lucas[-2])\n\n    return lucas\n\nassert get_lucas(10) == [2, 1, 3, 4, 7]\n```\n\nThis function starts by initializing the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). It then enters a loop where it continually appends the sum of the last two numbers in the list to the list until the last number in the list is larger than the given limit. The function then returns the list of Lucas numbers.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement mentions \"lucid numbers\" but the function is named \"get_lucas\". I'm assuming that \"lucid numbers\" is a typo and meant \"Lucas numbers\".\n\nAlso, the problem statement mentions \"smaller than or equal to a given integer\", but the example given is [1, 2, 3, 5, 7] which are all less than or equal to 10. If you want the function to return all Lucas numbers less than or equal to a given integer, you should change the while loop condition to `lucas[-1] + lucas[-2] < n`.\n\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\n### Response:\nA Lucas number is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 2 and 1.
