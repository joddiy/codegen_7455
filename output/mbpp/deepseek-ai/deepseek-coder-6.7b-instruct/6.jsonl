Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if s[i:] + s[:i] == s:\n            return i\n    return n\n\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible rotations of the string and checking if the rotation is the same as the original string.
