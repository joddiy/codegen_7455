Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef tuple_to_dict(tup):\n    return {tup[i]: tup[i + 1] for i in range(0, len(tup), 2)}\n\nassert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}\n```\n\nThis function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary.
