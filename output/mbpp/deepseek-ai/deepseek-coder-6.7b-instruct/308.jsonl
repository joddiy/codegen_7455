Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_spaces(\"My Name is Dawood\") == 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(s):\n    return s.replace(' ', '%20')\n\nassert replace_spaces(\"My Name is Dawood\") == 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `replace` method of Python strings to replace all spaces with '%20'.
