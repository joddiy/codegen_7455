Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_odd([1,3,5]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            return num\n    return None\n\nassert first_odd([1,3,5]) == 1\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each number in the given list.
