{"task_id": "Mbpp/240", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef replace_list(list1, list2):\n    list1[-1:] = list2\n    return list1\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's list slicing feature to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The `-1:` in the slice means \"start at the last element and go to the end of the list\". The `=` operator then replaces this slice with the elements of the second list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\nIf the assertion is true, then the function is working correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef replace_list(list1, list2):\n    list1[-1:] = list2\n    return list1\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's list slicing feature to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
