The function initializes a dynamic programming (dp) array with -1 and iterates over the array from `i` to `n`. For each element at index `j`, it iterates over the dp array from 0 to `i` and updates `current_sum` if the current element at index `j` is greater than the element at index `x` and the dp value at index `x` is greater than or equal to 0. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `max_index`.
