{"task_id": "Mbpp/769", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(li1, li2):\n    return [i for i in li1 if i not in li2]\n\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements from the first list (li1) that are not in the second list (li2). The assert statement checks that the function returns the correct result.\n\nPlease note that this function does not maintain the original order of the elements in the first list. If you need to maintain the order, you can use the following function:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(li1, li2):\n    return [i for i in li1 if i not in li2]\n\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 15, 20, 30]\n```\n\nIn this version of the function, the order of the elements in the first list is preserved.\n\nPlease let me know if you need help with anything else.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
