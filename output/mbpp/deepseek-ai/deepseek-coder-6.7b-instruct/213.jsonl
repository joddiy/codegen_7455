Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef multiple_to_single(nums):\n    return int(''.join(map(str, nums)))\n\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\nIn this script, the `multiple_to_single` function takes a list of integers as input.
