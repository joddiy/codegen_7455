It initializes an empty dictionary `dic`. Then it iterates over each tuple in the input list. If the tuple is already a key in `dic`, it increments the value associated with that key by 1. If the tuple is not a key in `dic`, it adds the tuple as a key with a value of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function works correctly for the provided example.\n\nPlease note that the assertion in the problem statement is incorrect.
