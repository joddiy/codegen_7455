Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(lst):\n    freq_dict = {}\n    for sublist in lst:\n        for item in sublist:\n            if item in freq_dict:\n                freq_dict[item] += 1\n            else:\n                freq_dict[item] = 1\n    return freq_dict\n\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `frequency_lists` that takes a list of lists as input.
