{"task_id": "Mbpp/430", "completion": "\nSure, here is a Python function that calculates the directrix of a parabola given its vertex form (y = a(x - h)^2 + k). The function takes three parameters: a, h, and k.\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a, h, k):\n    return k - a * h**2\n\n# Test the function\nassert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198\n```\n\nIn this function, `a` is the vertex coefficient, `h` is the x-coordinate of the vertex, and `k` is the y-coordinate of the vertex. The directrix is calculated as `k - a * h**2`.\n\nThe assertion `assert parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2) == -198` is a test that checks if the function works correctly. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion will pass and nothing will happen.
