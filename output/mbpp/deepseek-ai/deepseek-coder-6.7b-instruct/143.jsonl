{"task_id": "Mbpp/274", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    # Loop through the even indices\n    for i in range(0, n, 2):\n        # Calculate the binomial coefficient\n        coeff = factorial(n) / (factorial(i) * factorial(n - i))\n        # Add the coefficient to the sum\n        sum += coeff\n    return sum\n\n# Helper function to calculate factorial\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nThis function uses a loop to iterate through the even indices of the binomial coefficient. For each index, it calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula nCk = nC(k-1) * (n-k+1)/k. It then adds this coefficient to the sum. The function returns the sum of the even index binomial coefficients.\n\nThe helper function `factorial` is used to calculate the factorial of a number. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the factorial.\n\nThe assertion `assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) == 8` is used to test the function. It checks if the function returns the correct sum of even index binomial coefficients for the input 4. If the assertion is true, the function works correctly. If not, the function needs to be debugged.\n\nPlease note that this function uses the formula for binomial coefficients and the factorial function, which are not the only ways to solve this problem. There are also other ways to solve this problem, such as using dynamic programming or recursion.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
