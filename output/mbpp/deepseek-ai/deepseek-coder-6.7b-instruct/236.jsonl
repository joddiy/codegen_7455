{"task_id": "Mbpp/470", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add_pairwise(t):\n    return tuple(t[i] + t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1))\n\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to create a new tuple. For each index `i` in the range from 0 to the second-to-last index of the input tuple, it adds the element at index `i` to the element at index `i+1`. The result is a new tuple where each element is the sum of its neighbors in the input tuple.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function works correctly for the given example. If the function is correct, it will not raise an AssertionError.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input tuple has at least two elements. If the tuple has less than two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`.\n\nAlso, this function returns a tuple. If you want to print the result, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef add_pairwise(t):\n    result = tuple(t[i] + t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1))\n    print(result)\n\nadd_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))  # prints (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\nThis version of the function prints the result instead of returning it.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
