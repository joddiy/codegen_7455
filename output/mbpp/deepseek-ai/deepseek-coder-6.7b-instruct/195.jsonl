Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50])==243\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef round_and_sum(numbers):\n    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]\n    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)\n    return total_sum * len(rounded_numbers)\n\nassert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]) == 243\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `round_and_sum` that takes a list of numbers as input.
