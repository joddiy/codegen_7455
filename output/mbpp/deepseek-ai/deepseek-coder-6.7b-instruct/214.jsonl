{"task_id": "Mbpp/440", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence):\n    # Tokenize the sentence\n    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n\n    # Part of speech tagging\n    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)\n\n    # Loop through the tagged words to find the first adverb\n    for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(pos_tags):\n        if tag in ['RB', 'RBR', 'RBS', 'WRB']:\n            return i, i+1, word\n\n    return None\n\nassert find_adverb_position(\"clearly!! we can see the sky\")==(0, 7, 'clearly')\n```\n\nIn this script, we first tokenize the sentence into words using the `nltk.word_tokenize` function. Then we use the `nltk.pos_tag` function to tag each word with its part of speech. We then loop through the tagged words and return the position and the word if it is an adverb.\n\nPlease note that you need to install NLTK library and download the Punkt and averaged_perceptron_tagger models. You can do this by running `nltk.download('punkt')` and `nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')` in your Python environment.\n\nAlso, please note that the function `find_adverb_position` returns a tuple of three elements. The first and second elements are the start and end positions of the adverb in the sentence, and the third element is the adverb itself. The positions are 0-indexed.\n\nIf there is no adverb in the sentence, the function returns `None`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_adverb_position(\"clearly!! we can see the sky\")==(0, 7, 'clearly')\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence):\n    # Tokenize the sentence\n    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n\n    # Part of speech tagging\n    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)\n\n    # Loop through the tagged words to find the first adverb\n    for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(pos_tags):\n        if tag in ['RB', 'RBR', 'RBS', 'WRB']:\n            return i, i+1, word\n\n    return None\n\nassert find_adverb_position(\"clearly!! we can see the sky\")==(0, 7, 'clearly')\n```\n\nIn this script, we first tokenize the sentence into words using the `nltk.word_tokenize` function.
