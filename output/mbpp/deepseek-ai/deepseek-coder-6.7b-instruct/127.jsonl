Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    primes = [True] * n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if primes[p]:\n            for i in range(p * p, n, p):\n                primes[i] = False\n        p += 1\n    return sum(primes) - 2  # subtract 2 to exclude 0 and 1\n\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\nIn this script, we use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than `n`.
