Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the first non-repeated character in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_non_repeating_character(\"abcabc\") == None\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_character(s):\n    count = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in count:\n            count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            count[char] = 1\n    for char in s:\n        if count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    return None\n\nassert first_non_repeating_character(\"abcabc\") == None\n```\n\nThis function works by first counting the occurrence of each character in the string.
