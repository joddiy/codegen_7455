{"task_id": "Mbpp/753", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_k(lst, k):\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]\n\nassert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `min_k` that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. It sorts the list of tuples by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the number) in ascending order and then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted list.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function works correctly with the given test case.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the second element of each tuple is a number. If the second element can be a string, you need to convert it to a number before sorting.\n\nAlso, if there are multiple tuples with the same minimum second element, this script will return all of them. If you want to return only one of them, you need to decide which one to return (e.g., the first one, the last one, a random one, etc.).\n\nIf you want to return only one of the tuples with the minimum second element, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef min_k(lst, k):\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]\n\nassert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]\n```\n\nThis script will return only one of the tuples with the minimum second element. Which one it returns is not specified, so it could be the first one, the last one, or any one of them.\n\nIf you want to return the first one, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef min_k(lst, k):\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]\n\nassert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]\n```\n\nThis script will return the first of the tuples with the minimum second element.\n\nIf you want to return the last one, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef min_k(lst, k):\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])[-k:]\n\nassert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]\n```\n\nThis script will return the last of the tuples with the minimum second element.\n\nIf you want to return a random one, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef min_k(lst, k):\n    return random.sample(sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k], k)\n\nassert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
