It returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has one key-value pair. The key is an element from the `keys` list and the value is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is an element from the `names` list and the value is an element from the `values` list.\n\nThe script then defines three lists and calls the function with these lists as arguments.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert convert_list_dictionary([\"S001\", \"S002\", \"S003\", \"S004\"],[\"Adina Park\", \"Leyton Marsh\", \"Duncan Boyle\", \"Saim Richards\"] ,[85, 98, 89, 92])==[{'S001': {'Adina Park': 85}}, {'S002': {'Leyton Marsh': 98}}, {'S003': {'Duncan Boyle': 89}}, {'S004': {'Saim Richards': 92}}]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef convert_list_dictionary(keys, names, values):\n    return [{keys[i]: {names[i]: values[i]}} for i in range(len(keys))]\n\nkeys = [\"S001\", \"S002\", \"S003\", \"S004\"]\nnames = [\"Adina Park\", \"Leyton Marsh\", \"Duncan Boyle\", \"Saim Richards\"]\nvalues = [85, 98, 89, 92]\n\nprint(convert_list_dictionary(keys, names, values))\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `convert_list_dictionary` that takes three lists as input: `keys`, `names`, and `values`.
