Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_smaller(t1, t2):\n    for i in range(len(t1)):\n        if t1[i] >= t2[i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `check_smaller` that takes two tuples as input.
