Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth hexagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert hexagonal_num(10) == 190\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the nth hexagonal number:\n\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n):\n    return n*(2*n-1)\n\nassert hexagonal_num(10) == 190\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the nth hexagonal number, which is n*(2n-1).
