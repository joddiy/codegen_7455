{"task_id": "Mbpp/412", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that removes odd numbers from a given list:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n\nassert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the even numbers from the input list. It does this by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., the number is even).\n\nYou can test this function with other lists to see if it works as expected. For example, `remove_odd([1,2,3,4,5,6])` would return `[2,4,6]`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to remove odd numbers from a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes odd numbers from a given list:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n\nassert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the even numbers from the input list.
