{"task_id": "Mbpp/567", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if a list is sorted:\n\n```python\ndef issort_list(lst):\n    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))\n\nassert issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])==True\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `all` function in Python, which returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true. The iterable in this case is a generator that checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one. If the list is sorted, all elements will be less than or equal to the next one.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns `True`, the assertion is true and nothing happens. If the function returns `False`, the assertion is false and an `AssertionError` is raised.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is supposed to be sorted in descending order, you would need to change the comparison operator from `<=` to `>=`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a list is sorted:\n\n```python\ndef issort_list(lst):\n    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))\n\nassert issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])==True\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `all` function in Python, which returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true.
