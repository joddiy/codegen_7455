{"task_id": "Mbpp/162", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2:\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):\n        total += n - 2 * i\n    return total\n\nassert sum_series(6) == 12\n```\n\nIn this function, we initialize a variable `total` to 0. Then we use a for loop to iterate over the range from 0 to `n // 2` (inclusive). For each iteration, we add `n - 2 * i` to `total`. Finally, we return `total`.\n\nThe assertion `assert sum_series(6) == 12` checks that the function works correctly for the example given in the problem statement.\n\nThis function works by summing up the terms of the series (n - 2*i) where i ranges from 0 to n // 2. The sum of this series is given by the formula `n * (n // 2) - (n // 2) * ((n // 2) + 1)`. If n is even, this simplifies to `n * (n // 2)`. If n is odd, this simplifies to `n * ((n // 2) + 1)`.\n\nHere is a version of the function that uses this formula to make it more efficient:\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n):\n    return n * (n // 2) if n % 2 == 0 else n * ((n // 2) + 1)\n\nassert sum_series(6) == 12\n```\n\nThis version of the function works by checking if `n` is even or odd and then using the appropriate formula to calculate the sum of the series.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
