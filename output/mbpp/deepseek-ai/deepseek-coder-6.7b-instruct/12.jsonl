Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes characters from the first string which are present in the second string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(s1, s2):\n    return ''.join([char for char in s1 if char not in s2])\n\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the first string (`s1`).
