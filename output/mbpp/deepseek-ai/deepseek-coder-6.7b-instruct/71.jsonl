{"task_id": "Mbpp/123", "completion": "\nAn amicable number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (not including the number itself). For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110; therefore, the sum of these divisors is 284. If the sum of these divisors is equal to another number and that number is not equal to 220 (in this case), then these two numbers are said to be an amicable pair.\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    sum = 1\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i:\n            continue\n        if i * i != n:\n            sum = sum + i + n // i\n        else:\n            sum = sum + i\n    return sum\n\ndef amicable_numbers_sum(limit):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, limit):\n        sum2 = sum_of_divisors(i)\n        if sum2 > i and sum_of_divisors(sum2) == i:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n\nassert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504\n```\n\nIn the above code, `sum_of_divisors(n)` function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number `n`. `amicable_numbers_sum(limit)` function calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to `limit`. It checks for each number if it is an amicable number by comparing the sum of its divisors with the sum of the divisors of the number obtained by the sum of divisors. If they are equal and the number is not equal to the sum of divisors, then the number is added to the sum.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly for the given limit.\n\nPlease note that this code may take a while to run for large limits due to its complexity.\n\nAlso, this code does not consider 1 as an amicable number, as per the definition of amicable numbers. If you want to include 1 as an amicable number, you can add a condition to check if `sum_of_divisors(i) != i` in the `amicable_numbers_sum(limit)` function.\n\nThis code is based on the assumption that the input number is a positive integer. If the input can be a non-integer or negative, you should add error checking code to handle these cases.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
