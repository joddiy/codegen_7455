{"task_id": "Mbpp/119", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that uses binary search to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.\n\n```python\ndef search(nums):\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == nums[mid ^ 1]:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return nums[left]\n\nassert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3\n```\n\nThis function works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and checking if the middle element is the one that only appears once. If it is, we know that the unique element must be in the right half of the array. If the middle element is not the unique element, then the unique element must be in the left half of the array. We continue this process until we find the unique element.\n\nThe `mid ^ 1` operation is used to get the index of the pair element. If `mid` is even, `mid ^ 1` will be `mid + 1` and if `mid` is odd, `mid ^ 1` will be `mid - 1`. This is because the pair element will be at the opposite end of the current `mid`.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(log n) because we are using binary search, and the space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the array has at least one element that appears only once and that the array is sorted. If the array does not meet these conditions, the function may not work correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
