Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    # The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is (1/2) * base * height * length\n    volume = (0.5) * base * height * length\n    return volume\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\nIn this function, `base`, `height`, and `length` are the dimensions of the triangular prism.
