If the character is uppercase, it increments a counter. If the counter is greater than the current maximum count, it updates the maximum count. If the character is not uppercase, it resets the counter. Finally, it returns the maximum count, which is the length of the longest run of uppercase characters.\n\nIn the given assertion, the string 'GeMKSForGERksISBESt' has a run of 5 uppercase characters, so the function returns 5.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find maximum run of uppercase characters in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_run_uppercase(s):\n    max_count = 0\n    count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            count += 1\n            if count > max_count:\n                max_count = count\n        else:\n            count = 0\n    return max_count\n\nassert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each character in the string.
