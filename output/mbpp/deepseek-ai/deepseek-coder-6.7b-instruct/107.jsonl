Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef re_arrange_array(arr, n):\n    # Separate positive and negative numbers\n    positive = [i for i in arr[:n] if i >= 0]\n    negative = [i for i in arr[:n] if i < 0]\n\n    # Append the remaining elements to the end\n    positive.extend([i for i in arr[n:] if i >= 0])\n    negative.extend([i for i in arr[n:] if i < 0])\n\n    # Combine the negative and positive numbers\n    result = negative + positive\n\n    return result\n\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\nThis script works by first separating the first n elements of the array into two lists: one for positive numbers and one for negative numbers.
