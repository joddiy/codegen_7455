Then it converts the reversed string back to an integer. Finally, it checks if the original number is equal to one less than twice the reversed number. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nIn the test case, `check(70)` returns `False` because 70 is not one less than twice its reverse (70 is not equal to 10*2 - 1).\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
