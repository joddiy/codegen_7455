The range function is used to generate these numbers, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time. For each number, we calculate its fourth power (i**4) and add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks that the function works correctly for the given example.\n\nYou can test this function with other values as well. For example, odd_num_sum(3) would return 328350.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
