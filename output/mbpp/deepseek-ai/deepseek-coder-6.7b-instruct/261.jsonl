Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5]) == [1, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes duplicate numbers from a given list:\n\n```python\ndef two_unique_nums(lst):\n    return list(set(lst))\n\nassert two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5]) == [1, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicate elements.
