Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find area of a sector. The function takes the radius and angle as inputs. Function should return None if the angle is larger than 360 degrees. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sector_area(4,45)==6.283185307179586\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the area of a sector:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sector_area(radius, angle):\n    if angle > 360:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return 0.5 * radius ** 2 * math.radians(angle)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the angle is greater than 360 degrees.
