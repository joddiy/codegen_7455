{"task_id": "Mbpp/261", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that performs the element-wise division operation on two tuples:\n\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a / b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the two tuples. It then uses a generator expression to perform the division operation on each pair of elements and returns the result as a new tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the second tuple (`t2`) will not contain zero, as division by zero is undefined in mathematics. If you want to handle this case, you can add a check for zero in the generator expression.\n\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a / b if b != 0 else 'undefined' for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nThis version of the function will return 'undefined' for any division where the denominator is zero.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that performs the element-wise division operation on two tuples:\n\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a / b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the two tuples.
