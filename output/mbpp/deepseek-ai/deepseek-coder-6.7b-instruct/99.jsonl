The end index in a slice is exclusive, so we need to add 1 to include the 10th element in the sum.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks that the function works correctly with the provided example.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_range_list(lst, start, end):\n    return sum(lst[start:end+1])\n\nassert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's list slicing to get the sublist from the start index to the end index (inclusive).
