{"task_id": "Mbpp/775", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if every odd index contains an odd number:\n\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate over the list with a step of 2 (starting from index 1, which is the second element of the list, since Python uses 0-based indexing). If we find an even number at an odd index, we immediately return `False`. If we don't find any even numbers, we return `True` after the loop.\n\nThis function will return `True` for the given list `[2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]`, as all odd-indexed elements are odd.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if every odd index contains an odd number:\n\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate over the list with a step of 2 (starting from index 1, which is the second element of the list, since Python uses 0-based indexing).
