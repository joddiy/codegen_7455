If it is, the function returns the number. If not, it repeats the process with the next number.\n\nThe assertion in the problem statement can be tested with:\n\n```python\nassert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input is always a positive integer. If negative numbers or non-integer values could be input, additional error checking would be needed.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer, returned as an integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n    while True:\n        n += 1\n        if str(n) == str(n)[::-1]:  # check if the number is a palindrome\n            return n\n```\n\nThis function works by incrementing the input number by 1 and checking if the resulting number is a palindrome.
