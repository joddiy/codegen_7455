The length of the resulting set is then returned as the frequency of unique tuples.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function works correctly. The list `[(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)]` contains three unique tuples, so the function should return 3.\n\nPlease note that the order of the tuples in the list is not considered when determining uniqueness. So `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` would be considered the same tuple.\n\nAlso, the order of the elements in the tuple is important. So `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)` would not be considered the same tuple.\n\nIf you want to consider the order of the elements in the tuple as well, you would need a different approach.\n\n```python\ndef extract_freq(lst):\n    return len([tuple(sorted(t)) for t in lst])\n\nassert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)] ) == 3\nassert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (2, 1), (6, 5)] ) == 4\n```\n\nIn this version of the function, we sort each tuple before adding it to the set.
