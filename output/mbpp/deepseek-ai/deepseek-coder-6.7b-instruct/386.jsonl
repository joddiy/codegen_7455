Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite function to find the sum of all items in the given dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef return_sum(dictionary):\n    return sum(dictionary.values())\n\nassert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `return_sum` takes a dictionary as an argument.
