The `isupper()` method is used to check if the character is uppercase. If it is, the character is included in the new string. If it is not, the character is not included. The `join()` method is used to combine the characters into a single string.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function works correctly by asserting that the string \"PYTHon\" should be transformed into \"PYTH\".\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to test it.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_lowercase(\"PYTHon\")==('PYTH')\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_lowercase(s):\n    return ''.join([i for i in s if i.isupper()])\n\nassert remove_lowercase(\"PYTHon\")==('PYTH')\n```\n\nThis function works by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string.
