If the element is already present, it is inserted to the right of the existing item.\n\nThis function works by using a binary search algorithm to find the insertion point, which makes it very efficient for large lists.\n\nIn the provided assertion, the function is used to find the right insertion point for the number 6 in the list [1,2,4,5].
