Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert power_base_sum(2,100)==115\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power:\n\n```python\ndef power_base_sum(base, power):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(base ** power))\n\nassert power_base_sum(2,100)==115\n```\n\nThis function works by first raising the base to the power, then converting the result to a string, and finally summing the digits of the string.
