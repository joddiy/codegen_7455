Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    return max(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:]))\n\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the array and comparing each element with the next one.
