It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the list, and the `map` function to convert each string in the tuple to a float. The `map` function returns a map object, which is then converted back to a list using `list()`. The result is a new list of tuples, where each string in the original list has been converted to a float.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the script tests the function with the provided example input, and checks that the output matches the expected output.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert list_to_float( [(\"3\", \"4\"), (\"1\", \"26.45\"), (\"7.32\", \"8\"), (\"4\", \"8\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef list_to_float(lst):\n    return [tuple(map(float, tup)) for tup in lst]\n\nassert list_to_float( [(\"3\", \"4\"), (\"1\", \"26.45\"), (\"7.32\", \"8\"), (\"4\", \"8\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `list_to_float` that takes a list of tuples as input.
