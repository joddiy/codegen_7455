Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n):\n    i = 0\n    while 2 ** i <= n:\n        i += 1\n    return 2 ** (i - 1)\n\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\nThis function uses a while loop to keep increasing the power of 2 until it is greater than `n`.
