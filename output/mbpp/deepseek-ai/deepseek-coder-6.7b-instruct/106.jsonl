Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find minimum of three numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that finds the minimum of three numbers:\n\n```python\ndef min_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return min(a, b, c)\n\nassert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's built-in `min` function to find the smallest of the three input numbers.
