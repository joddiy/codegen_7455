{"task_id": "Mbpp/632", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst if i != 0] + [i for i in lst if i == 0]\n\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a list of all non-zero elements in the input list, and then creating a list of all zero elements. It then concatenates these two lists to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the built-in `sort` function in Python, which sorts elements in ascending order. By setting the `key` parameter to `bool`, you can sort the list such that all zeroes are moved to the end:\n\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    lst.sort(key=bool)\n    return lst\n\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\nThis function works by sorting the list, with all zeroes being considered greater than any non-zero element. The `key=bool` part is necessary to tell Python to use the boolean value of each element for the sorting, which is `False` for zero and `True` for non-zero.\n\nBoth of these solutions have a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the list.\n\nNote: The `sort` function in Python modifies the list in-place, so if you want to keep the original list unchanged, you should create a copy of it before sorting.\n\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    lst = lst.copy()\n    lst.sort(key=bool)\n    return lst\n\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\nThis version of the function has the same time complexity as the previous version, but it also has the added benefit of not modifying the original list.\n\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    return sorted(lst, key=bool)\n\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\nThis version of the function also has the same time complexity as the previous versions, but it returns a new list that is sorted without modifying the original list.\n\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst if i != 0] + [i for i in lst if i == 0]\n\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\nThis version of the function has a time complexity of O(n), as it iterates over the list twice. It also returns a new list that is sorted without modifying the original list.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
