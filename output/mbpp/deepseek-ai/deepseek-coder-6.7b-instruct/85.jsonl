{"task_id": "Mbpp/139", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef circle_circumference(radius):\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius\n\nassert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `circle_circumference(radius)` calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The formula for the circumference of a circle is `2 * pi * radius`. The `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected result within a relative tolerance of 0.001.\n\nPlease note that the result of `circle_circumference(10)` is `62.830000000000005`, not `62.83`. The `math.isclose()` function checks if the two numbers are close within a relative tolerance, so the result of `62.83` is not considered close to `62.830000000000005`.\n\nYou can run this script to check if the function works as expected. If the function works correctly, it will not output anything. If there is an error, it will raise an `AssertionError`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the circumference of a circle. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef circle_circumference(radius):\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius\n\nassert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `circle_circumference(radius)` calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius.
