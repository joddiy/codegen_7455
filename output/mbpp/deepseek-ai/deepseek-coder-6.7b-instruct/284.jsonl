{"task_id": "Mbpp/597", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n    return sorted(arr1 + arr2)[k - 1]\n\nassert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6\n```\n\nThis function merges the two input arrays into one and sorts it. Then it returns the kth element of the merged and sorted array. Note that the index of the kth element is k - 1 because Python uses 0-based indexing.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input arrays are sorted in ascending order. If the input arrays are not sorted, you would need to sort them first before merging and sorting them.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that the kth element exists in the merged array. If the kth element does not exist, the function will raise an IndexError. You may want to add error handling code to handle this case.\n\nFinally, this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the total number of elements in the two input arrays. This is because the function uses the sorted function to sort the merged array.\n\nPlease note that this solution is not the most efficient one for large inputs. For large inputs, you would need a more efficient algorithm that can find the kth element in two sorted arrays in linear time.\n\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem in linear time:\n\n```python\ndef find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n    i = j = 0\n    while i + j < k:\n        if i == len(arr1):\n            return arr2[j + k - 1]\n        if j == len(arr2):\n            return arr1[i + k - 1]\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n        return arr1[i]\n    else:\n        return arr2[j]\n\nassert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6\n```\n\nThis function uses two pointers to traverse the two input arrays. The function returns the kth element as soon as it finds it. The function returns the smaller of the two current elements if the total number of elements processed is equal to k.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(k), which is more efficient for large inputs.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input arrays are sorted in ascending order.
