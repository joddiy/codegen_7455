The function then returns the 0th element of the nth row of the Bell triangle, which is the nth Bell number.\n\nThe Bell triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the numbers directly above it. The first row is [1], the second row is [1, 2], the third row is [1, 3, 5], and so on. The Bell numbers are the numbers in the 0th column of the Bell triangle.\n\nThe Bell triangle is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nbell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n\nwith initial conditions:\n\nbell[0][0] = 1\n\nand the Bell number of a row is the number in the 0th column of that row.\n\nIn the given assertion, `bell_Number(2)` returns 2, which is the 2nd Bell number.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
