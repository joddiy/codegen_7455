{"task_id": "Mbpp/312", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cone(radius, height):\n    return (1.0/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height\n```\n\nThis function takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`, which are the radius and height of the cone, respectively. It returns the volume of the cone.\n\nThe `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the calculated volume is close to the expected value, within a relative tolerance of 0.001.\n\nYou can use this function in your code like this:\n\n```python\nprint(volume_cone(5, 12))\n```\n\nThis will print the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 and a height of 12.\n\nPlease note that the `math.isclose()` function is used here for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would probably just use a simple comparison operator (`==`) to check if the calculated volume is exactly equal to the expected value.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the volume of a cone. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cone(radius, height):\n    return (1.0/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height\n```\n\nThis function takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`, which are the radius and height of the cone, respectively.
