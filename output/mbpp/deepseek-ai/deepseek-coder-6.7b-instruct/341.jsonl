If the function returns the correct area for an edge length of 3, the assertion will pass. If not, it will raise an AssertionError.\n\nYou can run this script in a Python environment to test it.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a Python function that calculates the area of a tetrahedron given the length of its edge:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef area_tetrahedron(edge_length):\n    return math.sqrt(3) * edge_length ** 2\n\nassert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the area of a tetrahedron, which is sqrt(3) times the square of the edge length.\n\nPlease note that the assertion statement is used to test the function.
