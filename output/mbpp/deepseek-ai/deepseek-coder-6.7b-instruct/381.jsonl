{"task_id": "Mbpp/790", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if every even index contains an even number:\n\n```python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert even_position([3,2,1]) == False\n```\n\nThis function uses a for loop to iterate over the list with a step of 2 (i.e., it only checks every even index). If it finds an odd number at an even index, it immediately returns `False`. If it gets through the entire list without finding any odd numbers, it returns `True`.\n\nIn the assertion, `even_position([3,2,1])` returns `False` because the number at index 0 (3) is odd.\n\nPlease note that in Python, list indices start at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.\n\nThis code should work for any list of integers. If you want to check if every odd index contains an odd number instead, you can change the loop to `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2)`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_position([3,2,1]) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if every even index contains an even number:\n\n```python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert even_position([3,2,1]) == False\n```\n\nThis function uses a for loop to iterate over the list with a step of 2 (i.e., it only checks every even index).
