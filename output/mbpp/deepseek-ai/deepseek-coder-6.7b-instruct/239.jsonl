Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)] , [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef tuple_intersection(tuples1, tuples2):\n    intersection = set()\n    for t1 in tuples1:\n        for t2 in tuples2:\n            if set(t1) == set(t2):\n                intersection.add(t1)\n    return intersection\n\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)] , [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each tuple in the first list and checking if it exists in the second list.
