It iterates over each element in the list. If the element is a list, it calls itself with this sublist as argument. If the element is not a list, it adds the element to the total sum. The function returns the total sum. The assertion checks that the function works correctly.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the input list is a list of integers or lists of integers. If the input list contains other types of elements, the script may not work as expected.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to flatten a list and sum all of its elements. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_list_sum(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for element in lst:\n        if type(element) is list:\n            total += recursive_list_sum(element)\n        else:\n            total += element\n    return total\n\nassert recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]])==21\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as input.
