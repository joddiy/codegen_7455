The `lst[0]` refers to the first element, and `lst[-1]` refers to the last element. The function then returns the modified list. The assert statement at the end tests the function with the provided example.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    # Swap the first and last elements\n    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]\n    return lst\n\n# Test the function\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list as input, and uses Python's tuple swapping feature to swap the first and last elements.
