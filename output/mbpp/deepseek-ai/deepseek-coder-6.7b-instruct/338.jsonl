The assertion at the end of the script checks that the function works correctly for the given example.\n\nPlease note that the formula used here is based on the properties of triangular numbers and the formula for the nth triangular number. The formula for the nth triangular number is `n*(n+1)/2`, and the formula for the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits is `ceil((sqrt((8 * 10^(n-1)) + 1) - 1) / 2)`.\n\nThe `math.pow(10,(n-1))` is used to calculate 10 raised to the power of (n-1).\n\nThe `math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of a number. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to check if the function works correctly.
