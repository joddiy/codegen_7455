The algorithm starts by comparing elements that are a certain distance apart in the list (the \"gap\"), and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The gap is initially set to the length of the list, and is gradually reduced by a factor of 1.3 each iteration, until it is 1. The list is considered sorted when the gap is 1 and no more swaps are needed.\n\nThe script then tests the function with the provided assertion.
