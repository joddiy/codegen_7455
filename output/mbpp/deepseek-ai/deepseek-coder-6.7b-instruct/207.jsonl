{"task_id": "Mbpp/432", "completion": "\nSure, here is a simple Python function that calculates the median length of a trapezium. The median length of a trapezium is the average of the two parallel sides.\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a, b, c):\n    return (a + b) / 2\n\n# Test the function\nassert median_trapezium(15, 25, 35) == 20\n```\n\nThis function takes three parameters: the lengths of the two parallel sides of the trapezium (a and b) and the lengths of the two diagonals (c). The function returns the median length, which is the average of a and b.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the lengths of the two diagonals are not used in the calculation. If you have the lengths of the two diagonals, you would need a different formula to calculate the median length of a trapezium.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the median length of a trapezium. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert median_trapezium(15,25,35)==20\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here is a simple Python function that calculates the median length of a trapezium.
