The `**` operator is used to raise each element to the power of 2, which is the definition of squaring a number.\n\nThe assert statement checks if the function works correctly. If the function returns the expected result, the assert statement does nothing. If the function does not return the expected result, the assert statement raises an AssertionError.\n\nYou can test the function with other inputs as well.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef square_nums(lst):\n    return [i ** 2 for i in lst]\n\nassert square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to square each element in the input list.
