{"task_id": "Mbpp/622", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_median(list1, list2, n):\n    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        median = (merged_list[n//2] + merged_list[n//2 - 1]) / 2\n    else:\n        median = merged_list[n//2]\n    return median\n\n# Test the function\nprint(get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5))\n```\n\nThis function first merges the two input lists into one sorted list. It then calculates the median based on whether the size of the merged list is even or odd. If the size is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the size is odd, the median is the middle number. The function finally returns the calculated median.\n\nThe assertion in the problem statement is a test case for the function. It checks whether the function correctly calculates the median of the two input lists. If the function's output matches the expected output, the assertion will pass silently. If not, the assertion will raise an error.\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that the input lists are sorted and have the same size. If this is not the case, you may need to add additional code to sort and merge the lists.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_median(list1, list2, n):\n    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        median = (merged_list[n//2] + merged_list[n//2 - 1]) / 2\n    else:\n        median = merged_list[n//2]\n    return median\n\n# Test the function\nprint(get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5))\n```\n\nThis function first merges the two input lists into one sorted list.
