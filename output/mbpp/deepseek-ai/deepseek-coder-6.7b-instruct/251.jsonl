{"task_id": "Mbpp/559", "completion": "\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem using Kadane's algorithm. This algorithm is used to solve the maximum subarray problem which consists of finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr, size):\n    max_so_far = arr[0]\n    current_max = arr[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, size):\n        current_max = max(arr[i], current_max + arr[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current_max)\n\n    return max_so_far\n\nassert max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8) == 7\n```\n\nIn this script, `max_so_far` keeps track of the maximum sum of the sublist found so far, and `current_max` keeps track of the maximum sum of the sublist ending at the current position. The function iterates over the list, updating `current_max` and `max_so_far` at each step. The final result is `max_so_far` which is the maximum sum of the contiguous sublist.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly. If the function returns the correct result, the assertion will not raise an error.\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that the input list is not empty and the size of the list is passed as a separate argument. This is because Python does not have a built-in way to get the size of a list.\n\nAlso, the function does not handle the case where all numbers in the list are negative. If that's a possibility, you would need to add additional code to handle that case.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
