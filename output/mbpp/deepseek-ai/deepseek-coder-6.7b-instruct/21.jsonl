Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(lst):\n    return max(max(pair) - min(pair) for pair in lst)\n\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `max_difference` takes a list of tuples as input.
