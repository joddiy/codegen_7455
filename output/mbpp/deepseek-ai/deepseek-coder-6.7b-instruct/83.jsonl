It counts the number of zeros in the array and calculates the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeros from the length of the array. It then returns the ratio of zeros to non-zeros. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected value within a relative tolerance of 0.001.\n\nYou can run this script in any Python environment to check if it satisfies the assertion.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef zero_count(arr):\n    zero_count = arr.count(0)\n    non_zero_count = len(arr) - zero_count\n    return zero_count / non_zero_count\n\nimport math\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `zero_count` that takes an array of integers as input.
