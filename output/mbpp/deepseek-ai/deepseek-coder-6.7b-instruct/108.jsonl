Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a string and character, replaces blank spaces in the string with the character, and returns the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_blank(\"hello people\",'@')==(\"hello@people\")\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that fulfills the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef replace_blank(s, c):\n    return s.replace(' ', c)\n\nassert replace_blank(\"hello people\",'@')==(\"hello@people\")\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `replace` method of Python strings, which replaces all occurrences of a specified character (in this case, a blank space) with another specified character (in this case, the input character `c`).
