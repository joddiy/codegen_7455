The function `are_equivalent(n1, n2)` compares the sum of the divisors of two numbers `n1` and `n2`. If they are equal, it returns `True`, otherwise `False`.\n\nThe assertion `assert are_equivalent(36, 57) == False` checks if the function `are_equivalent` returns `False` when comparing the divisors of 36 and 57.\n\nPlease note that this script might take a while to run for large numbers because the time complexity of the `sum_of_divisors` function is O(n).\n\nIf you want to optimize the script, you can use the fact that a divisor of a number `n` is always less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. This reduces the number of iterations in the `sum_of_divisors` function from `n` to `sqrt(n)`.\n\nHere is the optimized script:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if n / i == i:  # if both divisors are same\n                sum = sum + i\n            else:  # if divisors are different\n                sum = sum + i\n                sum = sum + (n//i)\n    return sum\n\ndef are_equivalent(n1, n2):\n    return sum_of_divisors(n1) == sum_of_divisors(n2)\n\nassert are_equivalent(36, 57) == False\n```\n\nThis optimized script will run much faster for large numbers.\n\nPlease note that the sum of divisors of a number includes the number itself, so if you want to exclude the number itself from the sum, you can subtract `n` from the sum in the `sum_of_divisors` function.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    sum = 1\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if n / i == i:  # if both divisors are same\n                sum = sum + i\n            else:  # if divisors are different\n                sum = sum + i\n                sum = sum + (n//i)\n    return sum\n```\n\nNow the sum of divisors of a number `n` will start from 1 and exclude `n` itself.\n\nPlease note that the sum of divisors of a number includes the number itself, so if you want to exclude the number itself from the sum, you can subtract `n` from the sum in the `sum_of_divisors` function.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    sum = 1\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if n / i == i:  # if both divisors are same\n                sum = sum + i\n            else:  # if divisors are different\n                sum = sum + i\n                sum = sum + (n//i)\n    return sum - n\n```\n\nNow the sum of divisors of a", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
