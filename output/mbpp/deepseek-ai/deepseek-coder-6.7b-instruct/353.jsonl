{"task_id": "Mbpp/755", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    m1 = m2 = float('inf')\n    for x in numbers:\n        if x <= m1:\n            m1, m2 = x, m1\n        elif x < m2:\n            m2 = x\n    return m2\n```\n\nThis function works by initializing two variables, `m1` and `m2`, to `inf` (which is a large number). It then iterates over each number in the list. If the current number is less than or equal to `m1`, it updates `m1` and `m2` to be the current number and the previous value of `m1`, respectively. If the current number is greater than `m1` but less than `m2`, it updates `m2` to be the current number. Finally, it returns `m2`, which is the second smallest number in the list.\n\nYou can test this function with your assertion:\n\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is implemented correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    m1 = m2 = float('inf')\n    for x in numbers:\n        if x <= m1:\n            m1, m2 = x, m1\n        elif x < m2:\n            m2 = x\n    return m2\n```\n\nThis function works by initializing two variables, `m1` and `m2`, to `inf` (which is a large number).
