If `num` is not in `lst`, `count` returns 0.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function correctly counts the number of occurrences of 4 in the list [1,2,3]. Since 4 is not in the list, the function should return 0, so the assertion passes.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of occurrences of a number in a given list:\n\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    return lst.count(num)\n\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\nIn this function, the built-in `count` method of the list data type is used to count the number of occurrences of `num` in `lst`.
