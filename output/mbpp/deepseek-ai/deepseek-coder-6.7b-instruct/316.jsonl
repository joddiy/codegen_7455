{"task_id": "Mbpp/638", "completion": "\nThe wind chill index is calculated using the following formula:\n\nw = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^0.16 + 0.3965TV^0.16\n\nwhere:\n- T is the temperature in Fahrenheit (so we need to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit first)\n- V is the wind speed in mph (so we need to convert km/h to mph first)\n\nHere is the Python function that calculates the wind chill index:\n\n```python\ndef wind_chill(velocity, temp):\n    # Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit\n    temp_f = temp * 9/5 + 32\n    # Convert km/h to mph\n    velocity_mph = velocity * 0.621371\n    # Calculate wind chill index\n    w = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temp_f - 11.37 * velocity_mph**0.16 + 0.3965 * temp_f * velocity_mph**0.16\n    # Round to the next integer\n    w = round(w)\n    return w\n\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\nThis function first converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and the wind velocity from km/h to mph. Then it calculates the wind chill index using the formula. Finally, it rounds the result to the next integer and returns it.\n\nPlease note that the wind chill index is not a reliable indicator of the actual weather, it is more of a theoretical calculation based on the observed wind speed and temperature.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\n### Response:\nThe wind chill index is calculated using the following formula:\n\nw = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^0.16 + 0.3965TV^0.16\n\nwhere:\n- T is the temperature in Fahrenheit (so we need to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit first)\n- V is the wind speed in mph (so we need to convert km/h to mph first)\n\nHere is the Python function that calculates the wind chill index:\n\n```python\ndef wind_chill(velocity, temp):\n    # Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit\n    temp_f = temp * 9/5 + 32\n    # Convert km/h to mph\n    velocity_mph = velocity * 0.621371\n    # Calculate wind chill index\n    w = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temp_f - 11.37 * velocity_mph**0.16 + 0.3965 * temp_f * velocity_mph**0.16\n    # Round to the next integer\n    w = round(w)\n    return w\n\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\nThis function first converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and the wind velocity from km/h to mph.
