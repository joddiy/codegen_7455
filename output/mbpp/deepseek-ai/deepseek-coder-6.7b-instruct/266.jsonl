Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to interleave 3 lists of the same length into a single flat list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert interleave_lists([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[10,20,30,40,50,60,70],[100,200,300,400,500,600,700])==[1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200, 3, 30, 300, 4, 40, 400, 5, 50, 500, 6, 60, 600, 7, 70, 700]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):\n    return [val for pair in zip(list1, list2, list3) for val in pair]\n\nassert interleave_lists([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[10,20,30,40,50,60,70],[100,200,300,400,500,600,700])==[1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200, 3, 30, 300, 4, 40, 400, 5, 50, 500, 6, 60, 600, 7, 70, 700]\n```\n\nThis script uses a list comprehension to interleave the three input lists.
