{"task_id": "Mbpp/457", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min(lst):\n    return min(lst, key=len)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. The `key` parameter is a function that defines how to calculate the key of each element in the iterable. In this case, we use `len` as the key function, which means that the `min` function will return the element with the smallest length.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]\n```\n\nIf the assertion is true, then the function works correctly.\n\nNote: This function will return the first occurrence of the smallest sublist if there are multiple sublists with the same smallest length.\n\nIf you want to return all sublists with the smallest length, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min(lst):\n    min_len = min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)\n    return [sublist for sublist in lst if len(sublist) == min_len]\n```\n\nThis function first calculates the smallest length, then uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the sublists with the smallest length.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [[1]]\n```\n\nIf the assertion is true, then the function works correctly.\n\nNote: This function will return all sublists with the smallest length if there are multiple sublists with the same smallest length.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
