Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_even(tup):\n    result = []\n    for item in tup:\n        if isinstance(item, tuple):\n            new_item = extract_even(item)\n            if new_item:\n                result.append(new_item)\n        elif item % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(item)\n    return tuple(result)\n\nassert extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)\n```\n\nThis script uses recursion to handle nested tuples.
