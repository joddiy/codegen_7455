Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_val(lst):\n    # Filter out non-numeric values\n    nums = [i for i in lst if isinstance(i, (int, float))]\n    # Return the minimum value\n    return min(nums)\n\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\nIn this script, we first filter out non-numeric values from the list using a list comprehension.
