If it doesn't find any such words, it returns False.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly. If the function returns True when it should, the assertion passes.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(text):\n    words = text.split('.')\n    for word in words:\n        if 'z' in word[1:-1]:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\nThis script splits the input text into words by the period (.) character.
