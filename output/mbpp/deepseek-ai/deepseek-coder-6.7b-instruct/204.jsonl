{"task_id": "Mbpp/429", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `zip` function to pair up the elements from the two tuples. It then uses a generator expression to create a new tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from the input tuples. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple.\n\nThe assertion in the problem statement can be tested with:\n\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the `and_tuples` function is working correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `zip` function to pair up the elements from the two tuples.
