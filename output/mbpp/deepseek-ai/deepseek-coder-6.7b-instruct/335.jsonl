Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that toggles all the bits of a number except the first and the last bit.\n\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n):\n    binary = bin(n)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    middle_bits = list(binary[1:-1])  # Get the middle bits\n    for i in range(len(middle_bits)):\n        middle_bits[i] = '1' if middle_bits[i] == '0' else '0'  # Toggle the middle bits\n    return int(binary[0] + ''.join(middle_bits) + binary[-1], 2)  # Convert back to decimal\n\nassert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the number to binary, then getting the middle bits (all bits except the first and last bit), toggling these bits (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s), and finally converting the binary back to decimal.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks that the function works correctly for the example given in the problem.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input number is a positive integer.
