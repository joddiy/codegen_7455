{"task_id": "Mbpp/293", "completion": "\nSure, here is a simple Python function that calculates the third side of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef otherside_rightangle(a, b):\n    # calculate the third side using the Pythagorean theorem\n    c = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n    return c\n\n# test the function\nassert otherside_rightangle(7, 8) == 10.63014581273465\n```\n\nThis script first imports the `math` module, which provides the `sqrt` function for calculating the square root. The `otherside_rightangle` function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, which represent the lengths of the two other sides of the triangle. It calculates the third side `c` using the Pythagorean theorem and returns it. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the result of `otherside_rightangle(7, 8)` is not equal to `10.63014581273465`, the script will raise an `AssertionError`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the third side of a right angled triangle.
