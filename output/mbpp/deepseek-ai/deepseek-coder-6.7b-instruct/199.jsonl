Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_rear(tup):\n    return [s[-1] for s in tup]\n\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple.
