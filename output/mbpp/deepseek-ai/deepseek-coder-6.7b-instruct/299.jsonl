Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))==[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(t):\n    return [sum(x)/len(x) for x in t]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the input tuple of tuples.
