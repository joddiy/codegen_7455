{"task_id": "Mbpp/84", "completion": "\nThe Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 1, 1.\n\nHere is a Python function to find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence:\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1]\n    if n == 2:\n        return [1, 1]\n\n    seq = [1, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        seq.append(seq[seq[i-1]-1] + seq[i-seq[i-1]])\n    return seq[-1]\n\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\nIn this function, we first handle the base cases where n is 1 or 2. Then, we create a list `seq` with the first two numbers in the sequence. For the rest of the numbers, we use the formula `seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]-1] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]` to calculate the next number in the sequence. Finally, we return the last number in the sequence.\n\nThe assertion `assert sequence(10) == 6` checks that the 10th number in the sequence is 6.\n\nPlease note that the indexing in Python starts from 0, so the 10th number is at index 9.\n\nAlso, the sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, and so on. So, the 10th number in the sequence is 6.\n\nPlease replace `10` with the number you want to find in the sequence.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
