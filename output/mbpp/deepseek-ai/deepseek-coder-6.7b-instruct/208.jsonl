Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if a given number is greater than all elements of a given array:\n\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr, num):\n    for i in arr:\n        if i <= num:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate over each element in the array.
