{"task_id": "Mbpp/222", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type:\n\n```python\ndef check_type(t):\n    return len(set(type(i) for i in t)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a set of the types of the elements in the tuple. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Therefore, if all elements in the tuple are of the same type, the set will contain only one unique type. If the tuple contains elements of different types, the set will contain more than one unique type.\n\nThe function `len(set(type(i) for i in t)) == 1` checks if the length of the set is 1, which would mean that all elements in the tuple are of the same type.\n\nYou can use this function in your assertion like this:\n\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if all elements in the tuple are integers, and fail if any element is not an integer.\n\nPlease note that this function does not consider subclasses of built-in types as different types. For example, `check_type((5, '6', 7.0, 3, 5, 6))` will return `False` because '6' and 7.0 are not integers. If you want to consider these as the same type, you would need to add additional logic to handle these cases.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type:\n\n```python\ndef check_type(t):\n    return len(set(type(i) for i in t)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a set of the types of the elements in the tuple.
