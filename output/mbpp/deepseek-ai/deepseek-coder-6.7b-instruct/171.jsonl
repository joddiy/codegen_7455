If it is, it returns 1 because the leftmost bit of 0 is 1. If the input number is not 0, it checks if the last bit of the number is 1. If it is, it returns the number as it is because the leftmost unset bit is already set. If the last bit of the number is 0, it returns the number plus 1 because the leftmost unset bit is 1.\n\nThe function uses integer division (//) to divide the number by 2 and then multiplies the result by 2 to get the number with the leftmost unset bit set. It then adds 1 to the result to set the leftmost bit.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion passes.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that sets the leftmost unset bit in a given number:\n\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        return n\n    return (n // 2) * 2 + 1\n\nassert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if the input number is 0.
