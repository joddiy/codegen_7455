{"task_id": "Mbpp/644", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    arr[:k] = arr[:k][::-1]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the first `k` elements in the array. The `[::-1]` slice means \"start at the end of the array and end at position 0, move with the step `-1`\".\n\nYou can test this function with your assertion:\n\n```python\nassert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIf the assertion is true, then the function works correctly.\n\nPlease note that Python uses zero-based indexing, so the `k`th element is at index `k-1`.\n\nAlso, this function modifies the original array. If you don't want to modify the original array, you can make a copy of it before reversing it.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    arr = arr[:]\n    arr[:k] = arr[:k][::-1]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis version of the function will work the same way as the original, but it won't modify the original array.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
