{"task_id": "Mbpp/602", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(string):\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in char_count:\n            return char\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    return None\n\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string. It keeps track of the count of each character in a dictionary. If it encounters a character that is already in the dictionary, it returns that character as the first repeated character. If it iterates over the entire string without finding any repeated characters, it returns None.\n\nPlease note that this function is case sensitive. If you want it to be case insensitive, you can convert the input string to lower or upper case before processing it.\n\nAlso, this function considers space and punctuation as valid characters. If you want it to ignore spaces and punctuation, you can add a condition to check if the character is alphanumeric before counting it.\n\nHere is an example of how to ignore spaces and punctuation:\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(string):\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if not char.isalnum():\n            continue\n        if char in char_count:\n            return char\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    return None\n\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abc abc\") == \"a\"\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abc,abc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\nIn this updated function, the `isalnum()` method is used to check if the character is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a number). If the character is not alphanumeric, the function continues to the next character.\n\nThis function will return the first repeated character in the string, ignoring spaces and punctuation.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
