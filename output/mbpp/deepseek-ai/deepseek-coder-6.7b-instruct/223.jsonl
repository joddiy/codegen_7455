For each number, we check if it is a factor of n (i.e., if n is divisible by the number). If it is, we check if the number is even (i.e., if the number is divisible by 2). If it is, we add the number to our sum. Finally, we return the sum.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function works correctly for the example given in the problem.\n\nPlease note that this function does not consider 1 as a factor, as per the definition of a factor. If you want to consider 1 as a factor, you can simply remove the condition `if i % 2 == 0:`.\n\nAlso, this function has a time complexity of O(n), which means it could be slow for large numbers.
