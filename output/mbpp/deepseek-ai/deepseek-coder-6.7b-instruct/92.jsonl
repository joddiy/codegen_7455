It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the elements of the first list that are not in the second list. The `assert` statement checks whether the function works correctly.\n\nYou can run this script in a Python environment to check the result. If the function works correctly, it will not output anything. If there is an error, it will raise an `AssertionError`.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to remove all elements from a given list present in another list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    return [i for i in list1 if i not in list2]\n\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `remove_elements` that takes two lists as arguments.
