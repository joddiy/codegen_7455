{"task_id": "Mbpp/250", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_X(tup, elem):\n    return tup.count(elem)\n\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples. This method returns the number of occurrences of an element in the tuple. In this case, it counts the number of occurrences of the number 4 in the tuple.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function returns 0 when it should return 0. If the assertion is true, the program will not output anything. If it's false, an AssertionError will be raised.\n\nYou can test the function with other inputs as well. For example:\n\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 2\n```\n\nThis will return 2, because the number 10 appears twice in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 3\n```\n\nThis will return 3, because the number 8 appears three times in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 5) == 2\n```\n\nThis will return 2, because the number 5 appears twice in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 2) == 2\n```\n\nThis will return 2, because the number 2 appears twice in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 15) == 1\n```\n\nThis will return 1, because the number 15 appears once in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 0) == 0\n```\n\nThis will return 0, because the number 0 does not appear in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((), 0) == 0\n```\n\nThis will return 0, because the tuple is empty and there are no elements to count.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((1,), 1) == 1\n```\n\nThis will return 1, because the number 1 appears once in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((1,), 2) == 0\n```\n\nThis will return 0, because the number 2 does not appear in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((1, 1, 1, 1, 1), 1) == 5\n```\n\nThis will return 5, because the number 1 appears five times in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 6) == 0\n```\n\nThis will return 0, because the number 6 does not appear in the tuple.\n\n```python\nassert count_X((1,", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
