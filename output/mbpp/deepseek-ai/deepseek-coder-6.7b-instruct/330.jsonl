Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that removes consecutive duplicates from a list:\n\n```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    return [lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i == 0 or lst[i] != lst[i-1]]\n\nassert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the list and only adding an element to the new list if it is not the same as the previous one.
