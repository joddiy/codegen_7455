Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_two_three(text):\n    pattern = 'ab{2,3}'\n    if re.search(pattern, text):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ab\")==(False)\nassert text_match_two_three(\"abb\")==(True)\nassert text_match_two_three(\"abbb\")==(True)\n```\n\nThis script uses regular expressions (re) to search for the pattern 'ab{2,3}' in the input string.
