{"task_id": "Mbpp/96", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the number of divisors of a given integer:\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by the current number (i.e., if `n` modulo the current number equals 0). If it is, it increments the count. At the end of the function, it returns the count, which represents the number of divisors of `n`.\n\nIn the assertion, we are checking if the function `divisor(15)` returns 4, which is the correct number of divisors of 15 (1, 3, 5, and 15).\n\nNote: This function has a time complexity of O(n), which means it could be slow for large inputs. If you need to calculate the number of divisors for large numbers, you might want to use a more efficient algorithm.\n\nAlso, this function does not count 1 and the number itself as divisors. If you want to count them, you can modify the function to increment the count by 2 at the end.\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n):\n    count = 2  # 1 and n are always divisors\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if n // i == i:  # if both divisors are the same\n                count += 1\n            else:  # if divisors are different\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\nIn this modified function, we only iterate up to the square root of `n`, which significantly reduces the number of iterations for large inputs. We also check if the divisor and the quotient are the same, and if they are, we increment the count by 1. If they are different, we increment the count by 2.\n\nThis function still returns the correct number of divisors for 15 (4), but it runs faster and can handle larger inputs.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If you need to handle negative inputs or zero, you should add appropriate error checking.\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer\")\n    count = 2  # 1 and n are always divisors\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if n // i == i:  # if both divisors are the same\n                count += 1\n            else:  # if divisors are different\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\nIn this final version of the function, we raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a positive integer.
