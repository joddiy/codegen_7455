The `isupper()` method checks if a character is an uppercase letter. If it is, the generator expression yields `1`, which is summed by the `sum()` function. The result is the total number of uppercase characters in the string.\n\nIn the assertion, the function is called with the string `'PYthon'`, which has one uppercase letter, so the assertion should pass.\n\nYou can test this function with other strings to see how it works.
