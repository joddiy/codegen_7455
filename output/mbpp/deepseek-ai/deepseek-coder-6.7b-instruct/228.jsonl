{"task_id": "Mbpp/458", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that calculates the area of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n\nassert rectangle_area(10,20)==200\n```\n\nIn this function, `length` and `width` are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The `assert` statement checks if the result of the function is equal to 200. If it is, the program continues to run. If it isn't, the program will raise an `AssertionError`.\n\nYou can test this function with different inputs to check if it works as expected.\n\n```python\nprint(rectangle_area(5,10))  # Output: 50\nprint(rectangle_area(15,3))  # Output: 45\n```\n\nIn these tests, the function returns the expected results.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
