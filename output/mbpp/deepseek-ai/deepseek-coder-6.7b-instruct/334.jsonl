The prefix sum of an index i is the sum of all elements from the start of the array to the index i, and the suffix sum of an index i is the sum of all elements from the index i to the end of the array.\n\nThen, for each element in the array, we calculate the sum of products of all possible subarrays that include the current element. If the current element is not the first or last element in the array, we add the product of the current element and the sum of prefix sum and suffix sum of the current element to the result. If the current element is the first element in the array, we add the product of the current element and the suffix sum of the current element to the result. If the current element is the last element in the array, we add the product of the current element and the prefix sum of the current element to the result.\n\nFinally, we return the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n).\n\nPlease note that the problem statement is a bit confusing. The sum of products of all possible subarrays of a given list is not the same as the sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list. The latter is a subset of the former. If you want to find the sum of products of all possible subarrays, you should use the prefix sum and suffix sum approach as shown above. If you want to find the sum of products of all possible sublists, you should use a different approach.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
