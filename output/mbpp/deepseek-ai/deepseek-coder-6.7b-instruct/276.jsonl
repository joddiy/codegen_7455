{"task_id": "Mbpp/589", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    return [i * i for i in range(int(start ** 0.5), int(end ** 0.5) + 1)]\n\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nThis function works by first determining the square root of the start and end numbers. It then rounds down to the nearest integer, because the square root of a number is always an integer. This gives the smallest integer `n` such that `n*n` is greater than or equal to the start of the range.\n\nThe function then generates a list of perfect squares by squaring each integer from `n` to `n+1` (inclusive), and returns this list.\n\nThe `assert` statement at the end checks that the function works correctly. If the function returns the correct list of perfect squares for the range 1 to 30, the `assert` statement will pass. If it does not, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.\n\nThis function assumes that the start and end numbers are positive. If they can be negative, you would need to modify the function to handle this case.\n\nPlease note that the `assert` statement is used for debugging purposes and is not necessary for the function to work.
