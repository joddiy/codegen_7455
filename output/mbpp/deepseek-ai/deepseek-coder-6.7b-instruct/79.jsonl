The loop continues until the two pointers meet in the middle. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\nPlease note that this function is case-sensitive. If you want it to treat 'a' and 'A' as the same character, you can modify the `vowels` string to \"aeiouAEIOU\".\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to reverse only the vowels of a given string (where y is not a vowel). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that reverses the vowels in a given string:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    s = list(s)\n    i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n\n    while i < j:\n        if s[i] not in vowels:\n            i += 1\n        elif s[j] not in vowels:\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n\n    return \"\".join(s)\n\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the string from both ends, swapping the vowels it finds.
