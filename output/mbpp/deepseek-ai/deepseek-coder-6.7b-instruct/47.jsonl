{"task_id": "Mbpp/93", "completion": "\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the power of a number:\n\n```python\ndef power(a, b):\n    return a ** b\n\nassert power(3, 4) == 81\n```\n\nIn this function, the `**` operator is used to calculate the power of a number. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the correct result, the assertion is true and nothing happens. If the function returns a different result, the assertion is false and an `AssertionError` is raised.\n\nYou can test the function with different inputs:\n\n```python\nprint(power(2, 3))  # Output: 8\nprint(power(5, 2))  # Output: 25\n```\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert power(3,4) == 81\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a simple Python function that calculates the power of a number:\n\n```python\ndef power(a, b):\n    return a ** b\n\nassert power(3, 4) == 81\n```\n\nIn this function, the `**` operator is used to calculate the power of a number.
