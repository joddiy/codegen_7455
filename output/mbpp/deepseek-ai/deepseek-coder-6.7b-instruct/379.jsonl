{"task_id": "Mbpp/787", "completion": "\nSure, here is a Python script that uses regular expressions to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_three(text):\n    pattern = 'abbb'\n    if re.search(pattern, text):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nassert not text_match_three(\"ac\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `text_match_three` that takes a string as input. Inside the function, we define a pattern `abbb` which matches a string that has an 'a' followed by three 'b'. We then use the `re.search` function to search for this pattern in the input string. If the pattern is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nThe `assert` statement checks if the function returns `False` when called with the argument `\"ac\"`. If the function returns `True`, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.\n\nPlease note that the `assert` statement is used for debugging purposes and should not be used in production code.\n\nAlso, the `re.search` function returns a match object if the pattern is found, otherwise it returns `None`. So, we need to check for `None` instead of `True` or `False`.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the script:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_three(text):\n    pattern = 'abbb'\n    return bool(re.search(pattern, text))\n\nassert not text_match_three(\"ac\")\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `re.search(pattern, text)` returns a match object if the pattern is found, otherwise it returns `None`. We convert this to a boolean using `bool()`, so that `True` is returned if the pattern is found and `False` is returned otherwise. The `not` operator is used to negate the result of `text_match_three(\"ac\")`, so that `True` is returned if the pattern is not found and `False` is returned otherwise.\n\nThis is a common idiom in Python for checking if a condition is not met.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
