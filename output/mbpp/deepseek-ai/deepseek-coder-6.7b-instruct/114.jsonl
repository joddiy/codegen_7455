{"task_id": "Mbpp/238", "completion": "\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of non-empty substrings of a given string.\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nassert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The number of substrings of a string of length `n` is `n*(n+1)/2`. This is because each character in the string can be the start of `n` substrings, and each character can also be the end of `n` substrings.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function returns the expected result, the assertion is true and the program continues to run. If the function returns a different result, the assertion is false and the program raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nIn this case, the assertion `assert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6` is true, so the program runs without error.\n\nPlease note that this function counts the same substring multiple times if it appears more than once in the string. If you want to count each substring only once, you would need to use a different approach.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python function that counts the number of non-empty substrings of a given string.\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nassert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
