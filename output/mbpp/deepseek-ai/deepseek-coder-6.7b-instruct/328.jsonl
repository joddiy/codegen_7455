Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)\n```\n\n### Response:\nHere is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(t):\n    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))\n\nassert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `multiply_elements` that takes a tuple `t` as input.
