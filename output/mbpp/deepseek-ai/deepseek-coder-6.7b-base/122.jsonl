The function uses the `count` method of the tuple to count the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple. The assertion checks that the function returns 0 when the tuple and element are given as input.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe function is tested using the `assert` statement. The assertion checks that the function returns 0 when the tuple and element are given as input. The assertion passes if the function returns 0 when the tuple and element are given as input.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe function `count_X` takes in a tuple and an element as input and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple.
