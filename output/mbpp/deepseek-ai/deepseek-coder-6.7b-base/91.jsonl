If so, it returns (n // a, 0) as the solution.\n\nThen, it checks if n is divisible by b. If so, it returns (0, n // b) as the solution.\n\nFinally, it returns None if no solution exists.\n\nThe assertion asserts that the function returns (2, 1) when given the inputs 2, 3, and 7.\n\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nassert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)\nassert find_solution(3, 5, 15) == (3, 2)\nassert find_solution(4, 6, 12) == (3, 0)\nassert find_solution(7, 11, 22) == (2, 1)\nassert find_solution(13, 17, 31) == (1, 2)\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThis function is a simple solution to the problem of finding integers x and y such that ax + by = n. It uses a series of if statements to check if n is divisible by a, b, or both, and returns the appropriate solution or None if no solution exists.\n\nThe assertion asserts that the function returns (2, 1) when given the inputs 2, 3, and 7. This assertion can be used to test the function's correctness.\n\nThe test cases are a series of assertions that check the function's behavior for various inputs. These test cases can be used to ensure that the function is working correctly and to catch any bugs that may be present.\n\nThe reflection is a summary of the function and its test cases. It includes a description of the function's behavior and a list of the test cases used to verify its correctness.\n\n\n### Reflection:\nThis function is a simple solution to the problem of finding integers x and y such that ax + by = n.
