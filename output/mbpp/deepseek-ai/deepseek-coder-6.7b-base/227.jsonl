If it is, the minimum length is updated to the length of the current sublist and the minimum list is updated to the current sublist.\n\nFinally, the function returns the minimum list.\n\n\n### Testing:\n\nTo test the function, we can use the following code:\n\n```python\nassert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]\n```\n\nThis code asserts that the function returns the correct sublist for the given input list.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis code is a simple function that finds the sublist with the minimum length in a given list of lists. It can be used to solve a variety of problems that involve finding the sublist with the minimum length.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
