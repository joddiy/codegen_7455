The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of characters from `s1` that are not in `s2`, and then joins the list of characters into a string using the `join` method.\n\nThe assertion `assert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'` checks that the function correctly removes the characters from the first string which are present in the second string. If the assertion fails, the test will raise an error.\n\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a simple problem.
