{"task_id": "Mbpp/9", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(string):\n    rotations = 0\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if string[i:] + string[:i] == string:\n            rotations += 1\n    return rotations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `find_Rotations` takes a string as input and returns the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string. The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the string. For each character, it checks if the substring starting from that character to the end of the string, followed by the substring starting from the beginning of the string to the character before the current character, is equal to the original string. If it is, it increments the `rotations` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of the `rotations` variable.\n\nThe assertion `assert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1` checks if the function `find_Rotations` returns 1 for the input string \"aaaa\". If the assertion fails, the test case will fail.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(string):\n    rotations = 0\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if string[i:] + string[:i] == string:\n            rotations += 1\n    return rotations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `find_Rotations` takes a string as input and returns the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string.
