Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef wind_chill(wind_velocity, temperature):\n    return round(13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * (wind_velocity ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temperature * (wind_velocity ** 0.16))\n```\n"}
