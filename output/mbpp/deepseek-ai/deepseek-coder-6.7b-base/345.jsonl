The angle is divided by 360 to get the fraction of the circle that is covered by the angle. The fraction is multiplied by the radius squared and multiplied by pi to get the area of the sector. The area is returned.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe following tests were used to test the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sector_area(radius, angle):\n    if angle > 360:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return (angle/360) * (radius**2) * math.pi\n\nassert sector_area(4,45)==6.283185307179586\nassert sector_area(4,361)==None\nassert sector_area(4,0)==0\nassert sector_area(4,360)==50.26548245743669\n```\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe function works as expected. The function returns the area of the sector if the angle is less than 360 degrees. If the angle is greater than 360 degrees, the function returns None. The function also returns 0 if the angle is 0.
