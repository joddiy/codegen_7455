{"task_id": "Mbpp/262", "completion": "\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    return lst[:L], lst[L:]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `split_two_parts` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It returns a tuple of two lists, where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.\n\nThe function uses the `[:L]` and `[L:]` syntax to slice the list into two parts. The `[:L]` syntax returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the `[L:]` syntax returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`.\n\nThe function then returns the two lists as a tuple, using the `return` statement.\n\nThe assertion statement checks that the function correctly splits the list `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]` into two parts, with the first part containing the first three elements of the list and the second part containing the remaining elements.\n\nThe assertion statement should pass, as the function correctly returns the expected tuple `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
