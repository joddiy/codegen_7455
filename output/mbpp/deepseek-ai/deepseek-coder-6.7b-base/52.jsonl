The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers and multiply each number with the product of the previous numbers. Finally, the function returns the product divided by the length of the list.\n\nThe assertion checks if the result of the function `multiply_num` with the input `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)` is close to `-67.2` within a relative tolerance of `0.001`. If the assertion passes, the function works as expected.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a number.
