{"task_id": "Mbpp/390", "completion": "\n```python\ndef add_string(lst,string):\n    return [string.format(i) for i in lst]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes a list and a string as input. It returns a list of strings where the string is formatted with the elements of the input list.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assert statement. The function is called with a list of numbers and a string that contains the format specifier {0}. The function returns a list of strings where the numbers are formatted as strings.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function is a simple one-liner that uses a list comprehension to apply a format string to all elements of a list. The function is easy to understand and can be used in a variety of situations.\n\n### References:\n[1] https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to apply a given format string to all of the elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_string([1,2,3,4],'temp{0}')==['temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', 'temp4']\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef add_string(lst,string):\n    return [string.format(i) for i in lst]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes a list and a string as input.
