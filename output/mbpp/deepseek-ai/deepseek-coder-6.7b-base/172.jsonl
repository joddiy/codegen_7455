The function returns the volume of the cone using the formula above.\n\nThe assertion checks if the result of the function `volume_cone` with the given arguments is approximately equal to the expected value of `314.15926535897927`. The `rel_tol` parameter is used to specify the relative tolerance for the comparison. In this case, the assertion checks if the difference between the result and the expected value is less than or equal to 0.001.\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means that the function `volume_cone` is correctly calculating the volume of a cone with the given radius and height.
