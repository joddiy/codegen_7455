{"task_id": "Mbpp/282", "completion": "\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    return [list1[i] - list2[i] for i in range(len(list1))]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sub_list` takes two lists as input and returns a list of the difference between the corresponding elements of the two input lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the input lists and subtract the elements at the same index. The resulting list is returned.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assertion statement provided in the instruction. If the assertion statement is satisfied, the function is assumed to work correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `sub_list` is a simple and efficient way to subtract two lists element-wise in Python. It can be used in various applications where the difference between the elements of two lists is needed.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to subtract two lists element-wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    return [list1[i] - list2[i] for i in range(len(list1))]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sub_list` takes two lists as input and returns a list of the difference between the corresponding elements of the two input lists.
