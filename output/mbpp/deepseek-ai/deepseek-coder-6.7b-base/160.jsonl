{"task_id": "Mbpp/295", "completion": "\n```python\ndef sum_div(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sum_div` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all the divisors of `n`. The function iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if they are divisors of `n`. If they are, they are added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the `sum` variable is returned.\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can use the `assert` statement in Python. The `assert` statement checks if a given condition is true. If the condition is false, it raises an `AssertionError`. In this case, we are checking if the function `sum_div` returns the correct sum of divisors for the input `8`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `sum_div` is a simple function that returns the sum of all the divisors of a given number. It can be used to find the sum of all the divisors of a number, which can be useful in a variety of applications.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to return the sum of all divisors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_div(8)==7\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_div(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sum_div` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all the divisors of `n`.
