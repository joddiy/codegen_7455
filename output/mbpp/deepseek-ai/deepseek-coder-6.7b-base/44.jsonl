{"task_id": "Mbpp/90", "completion": "\n```python\ndef len_log(words):\n    return max(len(word) for word in words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `len_log` takes a list of words as input and returns the length of the longest word in the list. The function uses a generator expression to find the length of each word in the list and then uses the `max` function to find the maximum length.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the following code:\n```python\nassert len_log([\"python\",\"PHP\",\"bigdata\"]) == 7\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `len_log` is a simple and efficient way to find the length of the longest word in a list of words. It can be used in a variety of applications, such as finding the length of the longest word in a text file or in a list of words.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the length of the longest word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert len_log([\"python\",\"PHP\",\"bigdata\"]) == 7\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef len_log(words):\n    return max(len(word) for word in words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `len_log` takes a list of words as input and returns the length of the longest word in the list.
