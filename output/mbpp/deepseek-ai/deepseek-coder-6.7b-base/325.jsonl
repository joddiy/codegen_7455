The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices of the lists. For each index, it checks if the values at that index are equal. If they are, it increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns the count variable.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function returns the correct number of indices where the lists have the same values. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nThe input is defined as two lists of the same length. Write a function to count indices where the lists have the same values. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `count_same_pair` takes two lists as input and returns the number of indices where the lists have the same values.
