It uses the `find` method of the string to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the pattern in the string, or -1 if the pattern is not found.\n\nThe function then calculates the start and end indices of the pattern in the string by adding the length of the pattern to the index of the first occurrence of the pattern.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the pattern, start index and end index.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis function is a simple implementation of a search algorithm that finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a string. It uses the `find` method of the string to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string, and then calculates the start and end indices of the pattern in the string.\n\nThe function is not very efficient, as it only finds the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.
