{"task_id": "Mbpp/566", "completion": "\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n    return sum(int(x) for x in str(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sum_digits` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. The function uses a generator expression to convert each digit of the integer to an integer and then uses the `sum` function to add them up.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the `assert` statement to check that it returns the correct result for the given input.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `sum_digits` is a simple function that takes a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits. It is a good example of how to use a generator expression to convert each digit of the integer to an integer and then use the `sum` function to add them up. The function is tested using the `assert` statement to check that it returns the correct result for the given input.\n\n### References:\n- [Python documentation for the `sum` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum)\n- [Python documentation for generator expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `sum_digits` is a simple function that takes a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits.
