{"task_id": "Mbpp/435", "completion": "\n```python\ndef last_Digit(num):\n    return num % 10\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe `%` operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation. In this case, it is used to find the last digit of a number.\n\n### Testing:\n```python\nassert last_Digit(123) == 3\nassert last_Digit(1000) == 0\nassert last_Digit(100) == 0\nassert last_Digit(10) == 0\nassert last_Digit(1) == 1\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a simple one, and the solution is straightforward. The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation, which is the last digit of a number. The assertion tests the function with various inputs to ensure that it returns the correct last digit.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the last digit of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit(123) == 3\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef last_Digit(num):\n    return num % 10\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe `%` operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.
