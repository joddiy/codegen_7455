{"task_id": "Mbpp/755", "completion": "\n```python\ndef second_smallest(lst):\n    lst.sort()\n    return lst[1]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `second_smallest` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort` method, and then returns the second element of the sorted list using indexing.\n\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can call it with different input lists and check that the output is as expected. For example:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2\nassert second_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThis function is a simple one, but it demonstrates the use of the `sort` method and indexing to find the second smallest number in a list. It is a good starting point for learning more about Python lists and how to manipulate them.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef second_smallest(lst):\n    lst.sort()\n    return lst[1]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `second_smallest` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list.
