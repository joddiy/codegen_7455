{"task_id": "Mbpp/562", "completion": "\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `Find_Max_Length` takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. It does this by iterating through the list of lists and comparing the lengths of each sublist to the current maximum length. If a sublist is longer than the current maximum length, it updates the maximum length to the length of that sublist. Finally, it returns the maximum length.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assertion provided in the instruction. The assertion checks that the function returns the correct length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists. If the assertion passes, the function is working correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code snippet provides a simple solution to the problem of finding the length of the longest sublists in a list of lists. It is a straightforward implementation of the problem and can be easily adapted to other similar problems.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the length of the longest sublists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `Find_Max_Length` takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist.
