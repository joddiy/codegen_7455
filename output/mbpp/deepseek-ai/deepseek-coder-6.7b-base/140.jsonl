Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through the first `n` even natural numbers. For each number, it raises it to the fifth power and adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the `sum` variable.\n\nThe assertion `assert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056` checks that the function returns the correct sum for the first two even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a good example of how to use a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers and perform a calculation on each number. The function `even_Power_Sum` takes in an integer `n` and returns the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power.\n\nThe assertion `assert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056` checks that the function returns the correct sum for the first two even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a for loop and a simple mathematical formula. The formula for the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power is `(2n+1)^5/32`.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a good example of how to use a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers and perform a calculation on each number.
