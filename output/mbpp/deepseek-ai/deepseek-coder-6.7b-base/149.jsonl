{"task_id": "Mbpp/281", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef all_unique(lst):\n    return len(set(lst)) == len(lst)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe `all_unique` function takes a list of elements as input and returns `True` if all the elements are unique, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `set` function to create a set of unique elements from the input list. The `len` function is used to get the length of the input list and the length of the set. If the lengths are equal, it means that all the elements in the input list are unique, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the `all_unique` function with the given input. If the assertion is true, it means that the function is working correctly and the test passes. If the assertion is false, it means that the function is not working correctly and the test fails.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
