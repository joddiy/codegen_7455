The conversion is done by multiplying the `degree` by `pi` and dividing the result by `180`.\n\nThe assertion `assert radian_degree(90)==1.5707963267948966` checks if the result of the `radian_degree` function with the argument `90` is equal to `1.5707963267948966`. If the assertion is true, the function works as expected. If the assertion is false, the function may not be working as expected.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a simple one, but it demonstrates the importance of writing clear and concise code. The assertion is a good way to test the function, but it is not a substitute for testing the function in a larger context. Additionally, the assertion is not specific enough to determine if the function is working correctly.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a simple one, but it demonstrates the importance of writing clear and concise code.
