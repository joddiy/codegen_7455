The result is then checked to see if it is even or not using the modulo operator `%`. If the result is 0, then the product is even, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe assertion `assert is_product_even([1,2,3])` checks if the function returns `True` when given the list `[1,2,3]`. If the assertion fails, it means that the function is not returning the expected result for this input.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    product = 1\n    for number in numbers:\n        product *= number\n    return product % 2 == 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `is_product_even` takes a list of numbers as input and returns `True` if the product of all the numbers in the list is even, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses a loop to iterate over the numbers in the list and multiply them together to get the product.
