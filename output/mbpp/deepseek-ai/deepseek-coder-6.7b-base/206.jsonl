{"task_id": "Mbpp/431", "completion": "\n```python\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\n    for i in list1:\n        for j in list2:\n            if i == j:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes two lists as input and returns True if they have at least one common element. It does this by iterating through each element in the first list and comparing it to each element in the second list. If a match is found, the function returns True. If no match is found, the function returns False.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assert statement. The assert statement checks that the function returns True when given the lists [1,2,3,4,5] and [5,6,7,8,9]. If the function returns True, the assert statement passes. If the function returns False, the assert statement fails.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function is a simple solution to the problem of determining if two lists have at least one common element. It is a good starting point for a more complex solution that can handle more complex data structures.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\n    for i in list1:\n        for j in list2:\n            if i == j:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes two lists as input and returns True if they have at least one common element.
