The `len` function is then used to get the length of the set, which is the number of unique tuples in the list.\n\nThe assertion `assert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)] ) == 3` checks that the function returns the correct number of unique tuples for the given input list. If the assertion passes, the function is correct.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
