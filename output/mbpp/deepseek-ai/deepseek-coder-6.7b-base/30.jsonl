For each pair of integers, it checks if the difference i^2 - j^2 is equal to n. If it is, the function returns True. If no such pair is found, the function returns False.\n\nThe assertion asserts that the function dif_Square(5) should return True, which is the correct answer.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i**2 - j**2 == n:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function dif_Square takes an integer n as input and returns True if it can be represented as the difference of two squares, and False otherwise.\n\nThe function uses two nested for loops to check all possible pairs of integers i and j, where 0 <= i <= n and 0 <= j <= n.
