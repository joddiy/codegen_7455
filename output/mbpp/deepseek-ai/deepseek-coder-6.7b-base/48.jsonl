The function iterates over the list of tuples and keeps track of the index of the tuple with the smallest second value. The function returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe function is tested using the assertion statement. The assertion statement checks if the function returns the correct value for the given input. If the assertion statement passes, the function is working as expected. If the assertion statement fails, the function is not working as expected.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe function `index_minimum` is a simple function that takes a list of tuples and returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value. The function is written in Python and is tested using the assertion statement. The function is simple and easy to understand. The function is not optimized and can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)]) == 'Varsha'\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef index_minimum(tuples):\n    min_index = 0\n    min_value = tuples[0][1]\n    for i in range(1, len(tuples)):\n        if tuples[i][1] < min_value:\n            min_index = i\n            min_value = tuples[i][1]\n    return tuples[min_index][0]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `index_minimum` takes a list of tuples as input and returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.
