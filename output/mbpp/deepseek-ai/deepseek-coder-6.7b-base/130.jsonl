The function uses a while loop to generate new prime numbers until it has found the nth prime. The loop starts with a list of the first three prime numbers (2, 3, and 5). The loop then generates the next prime number by adding 2 to the last prime number in the list. The loop then checks if the new prime number is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the list. If it is not divisible by any of the prime numbers, the new prime number is added to the list. The loop continues until it has found the nth prime number. The function then returns the nth prime number.\n\nThe assertion `assert newman_prime(3) == 7` checks that the function returns the correct value for the nth prime number.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
