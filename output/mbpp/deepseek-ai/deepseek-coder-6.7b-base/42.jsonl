The function iterates over each element in `lst` using a for loop. For each element, it checks if it is already in the dictionary `freq`. If it is, the frequency is incremented by 1. If it is not, the frequency is set to 1. Finally, the function returns the dictionary `freq`.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assertion `assert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})`. This assertion checks that the function returns the correct frequency of each element in the input list. If the assertion passes, the function is working correctly.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `freq_count` is a simple and efficient way to count the frequency of each element in a list. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each element and returns the dictionary when the function is called. The assertion is used to test the function and ensure that it is working correctly.\n\n### References:\n- [Python Dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)\n- [Python Assertions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_assertions.asp)\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    freq = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        if item in freq:\n            freq[item] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[item] = 1\n    return freq\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `freq_count` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a dictionary `freq` that maps each element in `lst` to its frequency.
