{"task_id": "Mbpp/56", "completion": "\n```python\ndef check(num):\n    return num == int(str(num)[::-1]) * 2 - 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `check` takes an integer `num` as input and returns `True` if `num` is one less than twice its reverse, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function first converts `num` to a string using the `str` function, then reverses the string using slicing with a step of -1, and finally multiplies the reversed string by 2 and subtracts 1. The result is compared to `num` using the `==` operator.\n\nThe assertion `assert check(70) == False` checks if the function returns `False` for the input `70`. If the assertion fails, the function will raise an `AssertionError`.\n\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, you can call it with different inputs and check if the output is as expected. For example:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\nassert check(71) == True\nassert check(12345) == False\nassert check(123456) == True\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis function checks if a given number is one less than twice its reverse, which is a common mathematical problem. The function can be used to solve other similar problems as well.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
