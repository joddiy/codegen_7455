{"task_id": "Mbpp/640", "completion": "\n```python\ndef remove_parenthesis(string):\n    return string.replace(\"(\", \"\").replace(\")\", \"\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `remove_parenthesis` takes a string as an argument and returns the string with all parenthesis removed. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all parenthesis with an empty string.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the `assert` statement. The function is called with the argument `[\"python (chrome)\"]` and the result is compared to the expected result `\"python\"`. If the result is not equal to the expected result, the assertion fails and an error is raised.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function is a simple solution to the problem of removing parenthesis from a string. It uses the `replace` method to replace all parenthesis with an empty string. The function is tested using the `assert` statement and the result is compared to the expected result.
