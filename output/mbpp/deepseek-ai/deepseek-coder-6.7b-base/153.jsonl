The `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true and if it is, it will execute the code that is indented below it. The `elif` statement is used to check if a condition is true and if it is, it will execute the code that is indented below it. The `else` statement is used to execute code if none of the other conditions are true.\n\nI think this problem is a good example of how to use the `len()` function. The `len()` function is used to get the length of a string. I used it to check if the string was long enough to have the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.\n\nI think this problem is a good example of how to use the `==` operator. The `==` operator is used to check if two values are equal. I used it to check if the first character of the string was 'a'.\n\nI think this problem is a good example of how to use the `and` operator. The `and` operator is used to check if two conditions are true. I used it to check if the second and third characters of the string were 'b'.\n\nI think this problem is a good example of how to use the `return` statement. The `return` statement is used to return a value from a function. I used it to return `True` if the string had the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters and `False` if it did not.\n\nI think this problem is a good example of how to use the `assert` statement. The `assert` statement is used to check if a condition is true. I used it to check if the function returned the correct value for the given input.\n\nI think this problem is a good example of how to use the `assert` statement.
