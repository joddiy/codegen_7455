It iterates through the lists using a for loop and checks if the elements at the same index are equal in all three lists. If they are, the element is added to the `common_elements` list. Finally, the `common_elements` list is returned.\n\nThe assertion `assert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]` checks if the function returns the expected list of common elements for the given input lists. If the assertion fails, an AssertionError is raised.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWe say that an element is common for lists l1, l2, l3 if it appears in all three lists under the same index. Write a function to find common elements from three lists. The function should return a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    common_elements = []\n    for i in range(len(l1)):\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            common_elements.append(l1[i])\n    return common_elements\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `extract_index_list` takes three lists as input and returns a list of common elements.
