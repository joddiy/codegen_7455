The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of words. The list comprehension iterates over the words in the string using the `split` method, and only adds the word to the list if its length is at least 4 characters long. The function returns the list of words.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns the expected list of words. The assertion uses the `set` function to convert the list of words to a set, which removes any duplicate words. The assertion then compares the set of words returned by the function to the set of expected words. If the sets are equal, the assertion passes.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a common programming problem. The list comprehension used in the function `find_char_long` is a concise way to generate a list of words that meet a certain condition. The assertion checks that the function returns the expected list of words, which is a good way to ensure that the function is working correctly.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a common programming problem.
