{"task_id": "Mbpp/472", "completion": "\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst)+1))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `check_Consecutive` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `sorted` function to sort the input list in ascending order. Then, it uses the `range` function to create a list of consecutive numbers from the minimum value of the input list to the maximum value of the input list.\n\nFinally, the function compares the sorted list with the list of consecutive numbers and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can call it with different input lists and check that the output is as expected.\n\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,6]) == False\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == True\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5,7]) == False\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis function can be used to check whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not. It is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst)+1))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `check_Consecutive` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `sorted` function to sort the input list in ascending order.
