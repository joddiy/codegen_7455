{"task_id": "Mbpp/161", "completion": "\n```python\ndef remove_elements(lst1, lst2):\n    return [x for x in lst1 if x not in lst2]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `remove_elements` takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements from the first list that are not present in the second list. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list containing only the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function correctly removes all elements from the first list that are present in the second list. If the assertion passes, the function works as expected.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a common programming task. List comprehensions are a concise way to create new lists from existing ones, and they are often used to filter or transform elements in a list. In this case, the function `remove_elements` uses a list comprehension to generate a new list containing only the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function correctly removes all elements from the first list that are present in the second list. If the assertion passes, the function works as expected.\n\nOverall, this problem is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a common programming task.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
