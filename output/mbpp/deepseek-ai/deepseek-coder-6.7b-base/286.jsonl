The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n`, adding each number to the `sum` variable. After the loop, the average is calculated by dividing the `sum` by `n`. The function returns the `sum` and `average` as a tuple.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `sum_average` is a simple function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the average of those numbers.

The function returns the `sum` and `average` as a tuple.\n\nThe assertion `assert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)` tests the function `sum_average` with the input `10` and checks that the function returns the expected tuple `(55, 5.5)`. If the assertion passes, the function is working as expected. If the assertion fails, the function is not working as expected and needs to be fixed.\n\nThe function `sum_average` is a simple function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the average of those numbers.
