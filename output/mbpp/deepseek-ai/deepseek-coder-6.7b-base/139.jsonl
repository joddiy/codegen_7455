{"task_id": "Mbpp/270", "completion": "\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst):\n    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sum_even_and_even_index` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of all even numbers at even indices in the list. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of even numbers at even indices in the input list. The sum of this new list is then returned as the output of the function.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assertion `assert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30`. This assertion checks that the function returns the correct sum of even numbers at even indices in the input list. If the assertion passes, the function is working correctly.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `sum_even_and_even_index` is a simple and efficient way to find the sum of even numbers at even indices in a list. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of even numbers at even indices in the input list, and then sums up the elements of this new list to get the desired output. The function is easy to understand and implement, and it can be used in various applications where the sum of even numbers at even indices is needed.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst):\n    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sum_even_and_even_index` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of all even numbers at even indices in the list.
