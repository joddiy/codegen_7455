The function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the input list, and increments the count variable by 1 for each list element. Finally, the function returns the count variable.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the number of lists in a given number of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef count_list(lst):\n    count = 0\n    for i in lst:\n        if isinstance(i, list):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `count_list` takes a list of lists as input and returns the number of lists in the input list.
