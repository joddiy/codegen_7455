It does this by iterating through the list and keeping track of the number of zeroes and non-zeroes encountered. Once the loop is complete, the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes is calculated and returned.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns a value that is close to 0.181818, within a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the function should return a value that is within 0.001 of 0.181818, either above or below.\n\nThe function `math.isclose` is used to check if the returned value is close to the expected value. If the returned value is within the specified tolerance, the assertion passes. Otherwise, the assertion fails.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `zero_count` is a simple function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in the list.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef zero_count(numbers):\n    zero_count = 0\n    non_zero_count = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number == 0:\n            zero_count += 1\n        else:\n            non_zero_count += 1\n    return zero_count / non_zero_count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `zero_count` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in the list.
