The function iterates over each number in the list and checks if it is negative. If the number is negative, it is added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the `sum` variable is returned as the result of the function.\n\nThe assertion `assert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])==-32` checks if the function `sum_negativenum` returns the correct sum of the negative numbers in the list `[2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17]`. If the assertion passes, the function is working correctly.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
