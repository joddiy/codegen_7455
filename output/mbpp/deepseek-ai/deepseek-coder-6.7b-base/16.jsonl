{"task_id": "Mbpp/57", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef find_Max_Num(digits):\n    digits.sort(reverse=True)\n    return int(\"\".join(map(str, digits)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `find_Max_Num` takes a list of digits as input and returns the largest number that can be formed with those digits. The function first sorts the list of digits in descending order using the `sort` method. Then, it joins the sorted digits together using the `join` method and converts the resulting string to an integer using the `int` function. Finally, it returns the resulting integer.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe function is tested using the following code:\n```python\nassert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321\n```\n\nThis test asserts that the function returns the expected value when given the input list [1,2,3].\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe function `find_Max_Num` is a simple and efficient way to find the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits. It sorts the digits in descending order and then joins them together to form the largest number. The function is written in Python and is tested using a simple assertion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe function `find_Max_Num` is a useful tool for finding the largest number that can be formed with a given list of digits. It is written in Python and is tested using a simple assertion.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
