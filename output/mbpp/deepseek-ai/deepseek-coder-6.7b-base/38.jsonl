The first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1. The third number is 1 + 1 = 2, the fourth number is 1 + 2 = 3, the fifth number is 2 + 1 = 3, the sixth number is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.\n\nThe function `sequence` takes in an integer `n` and returns the `n`th number in the newman conway sequence. The function first checks if `n` is 1 or 2, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the `n-1`th and `n-sequence(n-1)`th numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe assertion `assert sequence(10) == 6` checks that the 10th number in the sequence is 6.\n\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sequence(sequence(n - 1)) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe newman conway sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
