The function returns a set of tuples that are common to both `tuple_list1` and `tuple_list2`.\n\nThe function first converts both `tuple_list1` and `tuple_list2` to sets using the `set` function. This is done to remove any duplicates from the lists and make the intersection operation more efficient.\n\nThe function then uses the `intersection` method of the `set` class to find the intersection of the two sets. The `intersection` method returns a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nFinally, the function converts the resulting set back to a tuple using the `tuple` function and returns it.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the function checks that the function returns the correct result for the given input.\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `tuple_intersection` takes two arguments, `tuple_list1` and `tuple_list2`, which are lists of tuples.
