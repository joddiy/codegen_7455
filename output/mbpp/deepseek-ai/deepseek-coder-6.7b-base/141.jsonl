{"task_id": "Mbpp/272", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef rear_extract(lst):\n    return [i[2] for i in lst]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `rear_extract` takes in a list of tuples and returns a list containing the rear element of each tuple. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and extract the rear element of each tuple. The rear element is accessed using the index `2`, which is the index of the rear element in the tuple. The list comprehension returns a list containing the rear element of each tuple.\n\nThe assertion `assert rear_extract([(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]) == [21, 20, 19]` checks if the output of the function `rear_extract` is equal to the expected output `[21, 20, 19]`. If the assertion is true, the function works as expected. If the assertion is false, the function does not work as expected and needs to be fixed.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
