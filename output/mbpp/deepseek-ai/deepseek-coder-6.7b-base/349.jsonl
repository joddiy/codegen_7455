For each node, it checks if the node's value is less than or equal to the values of its left and right child nodes. If the node's value is greater than either of its child nodes, the function returns `False`.\n\nIf the function completes the iteration without returning `False`, it means that the array represents a min heap, and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe function uses the following formulas to determine the indices of the left and right child nodes of a node at index `i`:\n\n- Left child node: `2 * i + 1`\n- Right child node: `2 * i + 2`\n\nThe function also checks if the right child node exists before accessing its value. If the right child node does not exist, the function assumes that it has no right child and continues to the next node.\n\nThe function uses the `assert` statement to test the function's output against the expected result. The assertion should pass if the function correctly identifies the array as a min heap.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested by calling it with different input arrays and checking the output against the expected result. The following tests are performed:\n\n- Test 1: The function is called with an array that represents a min heap. The function should return `True`.\n- Test 2: The function is called with an array that represents a max heap. The function should return `False`.\n- Test 3: The function is called with an array that represents a binary tree that is not a min heap. The function should return `False`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `check_min_heap` correctly identifies min heaps and returns `True`, and it correctly identifies arrays that are not min heaps and returns `False`. The function also correctly handles arrays that have no right child node.\n\n### References:\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-a-given-array-represents-a-binary-heap/\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/min-heap-in-python/\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-heap/\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
