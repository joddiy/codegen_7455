Since the sides are all equal in length, the perimeter is simply the side length multiplied by 4.\n\n### Testing:\n\nTo test the function, we can use the `assert` statement in Python. The `assert` statement checks if a given condition is true, and if it is not, it raises an error. In this case, we want to check if the function returns the correct perimeter for a square with side length 10. We can do this by calling the function and comparing its output to the expected value of 40.\n\n```python\nassert square_perimeter(10) == 40\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, the function is correct. If it fails, the function is incorrect and needs to be fixed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the function `square_perimeter` returns the perimeter of a square given its side length as input. The assertion checks if the function returns the correct perimeter for a square with side length 10. If the assertion passes, the function is correct. If it fails, the function is incorrect and needs to be fixed.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
