For each character, it checks if it is uppercase using the isupper() method. If it is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase using the lower() method and appends it to the new string. If it is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase using the upper() method and appends it to the new string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the new string.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assert statement. The assert statement checks if the function returns the expected output for the given input. If the assertion fails, an AssertionError is raised.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function toggle_string() takes a string as input and returns a new string with all the characters in the original string toggled. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string and checks if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase and vice versa. The function returns the new string.\n\n### References:\nThe isupper() and lower() methods are used to check if a character is uppercase or lowercase, respectively. The upper() and lower() methods are used to convert a character to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.\n\n### Author:\nThis code was written by [Your Name].\n\n### License:\nThis code is licensed under the [License Name].\n\n### Acknowledgements:\nThis code was inspired by [Source Name].\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
