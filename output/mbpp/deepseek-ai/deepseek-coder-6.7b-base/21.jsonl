The absolute value of the difference is then added to the maximum difference found so far.\n\nFinally, the function returns the maximum difference found.\n\nThe assertion `assert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7` checks that the function returns the correct value for the given input.\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, you can call it with different input values and check that the returned value is correct. For example:\n```python\nprint(max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]))  # Output: 7\nprint(max_difference([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]))  # Output: 4\nprint(max_difference([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `max_difference` is a good solution for the given problem. It iterates through the list of tuples and calculates the difference between the first elements of the tuples and the difference between the second elements of the tuples. The maximum difference found is then returned.\n\nThe assertion `assert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7` checks that the function returns the correct value for the given input.\n\nThe function can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm for calculating the difference between the first elements of the tuples and the difference between the second elements of the tuples. For example, you could use a list comprehension to calculate the differences and then find the maximum difference in a single pass.\n\nOverall, the function is a good starting point for solving the problem, but there are still some improvements that can be made.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `max_difference` is a good solution for the given problem.
