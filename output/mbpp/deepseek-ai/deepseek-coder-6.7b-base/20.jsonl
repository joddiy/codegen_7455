{"task_id": "Mbpp/62", "completion": "\n```python\ndef smallest_num(lst):\n    smallest = lst[0]\n    for num in lst:\n        if num < smallest:\n            smallest = num\n    return smallest\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `smallest_num` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number in the list. It does this by initializing a variable `smallest` to the first number in the list and then iterating through the rest of the list, comparing each number to `smallest`. If a smaller number is found, it is assigned to `smallest`. Finally, the value of `smallest` is returned as the smallest number in the list.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the `assert` statement, which checks that the result of calling `smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` is equal to 1. If the assertion passes, the function works as expected.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis function can be used to find the smallest number in a list of numbers. It is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem, and it satisfies the assertion provided in the instruction.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef smallest_num(lst):\n    smallest = lst[0]\n    for num in lst:\n        if num < smallest:\n            smallest = num\n    return smallest\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `smallest_num` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number in the list.
