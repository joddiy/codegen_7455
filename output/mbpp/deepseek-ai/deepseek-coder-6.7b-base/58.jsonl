{"task_id": "Mbpp/104", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `sort_sublists` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and sort each sublist using the `sorted` function. The sorted sublists are then returned as a new list.\n\nThe assertion checks if the output of the `sort_sublists` function is equal to the expected output. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly and the assertion is satisfied. If the assertion fails, it means that the function is not working correctly and the assertion is not satisfied.\n\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sort_sublists(([\"green\", \"orange\"], [\"black\", \"white\"], [\"white\", \"black\", \"orange\"]))==[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `sort_sublists` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order.
