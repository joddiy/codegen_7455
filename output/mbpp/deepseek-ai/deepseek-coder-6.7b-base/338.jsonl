The program uses a while loop to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The program initializes the index to 0 and the count of digits to 0. The program then increments the index by 1 and calculates the number of digits in the triangular number. The program continues to increment the index and calculate the number of digits until the number of digits is greater than or equal to n. The program returns the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe above code is tested using the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Index(2) == 4\n```\n\nThe assertion is true because the index of the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 4.\n\n### References:\n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/index-of-smallest-triangular-number-with-n-digits/\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
