The list comprehension `[x for x in lst if x < 0]` iterates over each element `x` in `lst` and adds it to the output list if `x` is negative.\n\nThe assertion `assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]` checks that the function `neg_nos` returns the expected output for the input `[-1,4,5,-6]`. If the assertion fails, the test will fail and the script will raise an error.\n\nThe function `neg_nos` can be used to find negative numbers in a list of numbers. For example, `neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6])` returns `[-1,-6]`.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe function `neg_nos` is a simple function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of all negative numbers in the input list.
