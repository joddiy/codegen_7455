In this case, the delimiter is the space character. The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected list of strings.\n\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a simple one, but it demonstrates the importance of writing clear and concise code. The function `string_to_list` takes a string as input and returns a list of strings split on the space character. The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected list of strings.\n\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a simple one, but it demonstrates the importance of writing clear and concise code.
