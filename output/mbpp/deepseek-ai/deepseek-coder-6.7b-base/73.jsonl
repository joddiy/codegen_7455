It iterates over each character in the binary string and updates the counts accordingly. If the number of 0s and 1s are equal, it updates the maximum length if the current sub-string is longer than the previous maximum length. If the number of 0s becomes greater than the number of 1s, it resets the counts to 0.\n\nThe function returns the maximum length found.\n\nThe assertion `assert find_length(\"11000010001\") == 6` checks if the function returns the correct result for the given binary string.\n\n### Code:\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string):\n    max_length = 0\n    count_0 = 0\n    count_1 = 0\n    for char in binary_string:\n        if char == '0':\n            count_0 += 1\n        else:\n            count_1 += 1\n        if count_0 == count_1:\n            max_length = max(max_length, count_0 + count_1)\n        elif count_0 > count_1:\n            count_0 = 0\n            count_1 = 0\n    return max_length\n\nassert find_length(\"11000010001\") == 6\n```\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nassert find_length(\"11000010001\") == 6\nassert find_length(\"11111111111\") == 0\nassert find_length(\"00000000000\") == 0\nassert find_length(\"10101010101\") == 10\nassert find_length(\"11100011111\") == 6\n```\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `find_length` takes a binary string as input and returns the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.\n\nThe function uses two variables `count_0` and `count_1` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
