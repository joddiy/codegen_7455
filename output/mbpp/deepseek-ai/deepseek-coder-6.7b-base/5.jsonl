{"task_id": "Mbpp/8", "completion": "\n```python\ndef square_nums(nums):\n    return [num**2 for num in nums]\n```\n\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `square_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of their squares. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and compute its square. The result is returned as a new list.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function `square_nums` correctly squares the numbers in the input list. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working as expected.\n\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function `square_nums`, you can call the function with a list of numbers and check if the returned list is correct. For example:\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nsquared_nums = square_nums(nums)\nassert squared_nums == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `square_nums` is a simple and efficient way to square individual elements in a list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and compute its square. The assertion checks if the function is working as expected and the testing shows that the function is correctly squaring the numbers in the input list.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find squares of individual elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef square_nums(nums):\n    return [num**2 for num in nums]\n```\n\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `square_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of their squares.
