In this case, the function returns the sum of the number of possible sequences of length `n-1`, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to `m`, for each value of `i` between 1 and `m`, inclusive, such that `i` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n\nThe assertion `assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4` checks that the function returns the correct value for the given input.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function can be tested by calling it with different values of `m` and `n` and checking that the returned value is correct.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis function is a recursive implementation of the problem of finding the number of possible sequences of length `n`, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to `m`. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1. The recursive case is when `n` is greater than 1.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sum(get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n-1) for i in range(1, m+1) if i >= n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `get_total_number_of_sequences` takes in two positive integers `m` and `n` and returns the number of possible sequences of length `n`, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to `m`.\n\nThe base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.\n\nThe recursive case is when `n` is greater than 1.
