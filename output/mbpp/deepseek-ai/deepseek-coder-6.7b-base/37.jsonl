The sum of these values is 294. The remainder of 294 divided by 26 is 2, which corresponds to the character 'c'.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef get_Char(string):\n    # Write your code here\n    return char\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe ASCII value of a is 97, b is 98, and c is 99.
