{"task_id": "Mbpp/554", "completion": "\n```python\ndef Split(list):\n    return [i for i in list if i % 2 == 1]\n```\n\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `Split` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of only the odd integers in the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and return a new list containing only the odd integers. The function returns the new list.\n\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the assertion statement provided in the instruction. The assertion statement checks if the function returns the expected output for the input list [1,2,3,4,5,6]. If the assertion statement passes, the function is assumed to work correctly.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `Split` is a simple and efficient way to filter out the odd integers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and return a new list containing only the odd integers. The function is tested using the assertion statement provided in the instruction and is assumed to work correctly.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef Split(list):\n    return [i for i in list if i % 2 == 1]\n```\n\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `Split` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of only the odd integers in the input list.
