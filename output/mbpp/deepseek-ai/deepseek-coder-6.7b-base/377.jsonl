The `tuple` function is used to convert the list of integers returned by the `map` function to a tuple. The `map` function is used to apply the `int` function to each element of the string tuple. The `int` function is used to convert each element of the string tuple to an integer.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. It checks if the function returns the expected tuple `(7, 8, 9)` when given the string `\"(7, 8, 9)\"`. If the function returns the expected tuple, the assertion passes. If the function returns a different tuple, the assertion fails and an error is raised.\n\n### Reflection:\nThis problem is a good example of how to use the `tuple` and `map` functions in Python.

In this case, the `int` function is used to convert each element of the string tuple to an integer.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to test the function. It checks if the function returns the expected tuple when given a specific input. If the function returns the expected tuple, the assertion passes.
