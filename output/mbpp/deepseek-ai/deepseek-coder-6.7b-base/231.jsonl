{"task_id": "Mbpp/461", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef upper_ctr(string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        if char.isupper():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `upper_ctr` takes a string as input and returns the number of uppercase characters in the string. The function uses a loop to iterate over each character in the string, and uses the `isupper` method to check if the character is uppercase. If it is, the function increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns the count variable.\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check that the function returns the correct number of uppercase characters for different input strings. For example:\n```python\nassert upper_ctr('PYthon') == 1\nassert upper_ctr('PYthon') == 1\nassert upper_ctr('PYthon') == 1\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis function can be used to count the number of uppercase characters in a string. It can be useful in a variety of applications, such as validating user input or counting the number of uppercase characters in a document.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to count the upper case characters in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert upper_ctr('PYthon') == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef upper_ctr(string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        if char.isupper():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `upper_ctr` takes a string as input and returns the number of uppercase characters in the string.
