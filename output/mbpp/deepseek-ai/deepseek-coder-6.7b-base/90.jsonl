It does this by iterating through the array and comparing the absolute difference between each pair of elements. The maximum difference found so far is stored in a variable called max_diff, which is initialized to 0.\n\nThe function then iterates through the array using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through the elements of the array, and the inner loop iterates through the elements of the array after the current element. For each pair of elements, the function calculates the absolute difference between them and compares it to the current maximum difference. If the absolute difference is greater than the current maximum difference, the function updates the maximum difference to the new value.\n\nFinally, the function returns the maximum difference found.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
