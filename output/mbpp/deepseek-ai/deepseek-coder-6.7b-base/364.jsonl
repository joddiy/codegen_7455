{"task_id": "Mbpp/769", "completion": "\n```python\ndef Diff(li1, li2):\n    return (list(set(li1) - set(li2)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes two lists as arguments and returns the difference between the two lists. The function uses the set() function to convert the lists into sets, and then uses the difference() method to find the difference between the two sets. The difference() method returns a set of elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. The function then converts the set back into a list and returns it.\n\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can use the assert statement to check if the function returns the correct output for the given input. We can also use the assert statement to check if the function raises an exception when the input is invalid.\n\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\n\n### References:\n- [Python set()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set.asp)\n- [Python difference()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_difference.asp)\n- [Python assert()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp)\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
