{"task_id": "Mbpp/611", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\n    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `max_of_nth` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input. It returns the maximum value in the `n`th column of the matrix.\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`th element of each row in the matrix. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value in the list of extracted elements.\n\nThe assertion `assert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19` checks that the function returns the correct value for the given input. If the assertion fails, an `AssertionError` will be raised.\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\n    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `max_of_nth` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input.
