For each pair of indices `i` and `j`, it checks if the element at index `i` is less than the element at index `j`. If this condition is satisfied, it calculates the product of the two elements and updates the maximum product if the product is greater than the current maximum.\n\nFinally, the function returns the maximum product found.\n\nThe assertion `assert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000` checks if the function returns the correct maximum product for the given input array. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working as expected.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use a nested loop to solve a problem.
