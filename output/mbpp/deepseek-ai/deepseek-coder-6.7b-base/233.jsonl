For each subarray, it calculates the product of its elements and updates the maximum product if the product is greater than the current maximum.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices of the subarray, the middle loop iterates over all possible ending indices of the subarray, and the inner loop calculates the product of the elements in the subarray.\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the maximum product and the current product.\n\n\n### Testing:\n\nTo test the function, we can use the following code:\n\n```python\nassert max_subarray_product([1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2]) == 112\n```\n\nThis code asserts that the function returns 112, which is the correct maximum product of the subarray [7, -8, -2].\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. The function `max_subarray_product` uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible subarrays of the input array. For each subarray, it calculates the product of its elements and updates the maximum product if the product is greater than the current maximum.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input array.
