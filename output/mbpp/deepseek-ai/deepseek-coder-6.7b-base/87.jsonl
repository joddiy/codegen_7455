It uses a for loop to iterate over the elements in the list in reverse order. For each element, it finds the index of the maximum element in the sublist of elements up to the current element. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the sublist, it reverses the sublist up to the maximum element and then reverses the entire sublist. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\n\nThe function uses the `index` method to find the index of the maximum element in the sublist. The `max` function is used to find the maximum element in the sublist. The `[::-1]` syntax is used to reverse a list.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements in the list in reverse order. The loop variable `i` is used to keep track of the current element in the list. The loop starts at the last element in the list and ends at the second element in the list.
