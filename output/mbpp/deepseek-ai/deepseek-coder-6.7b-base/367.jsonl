It uses a list comprehension to create a new list of words from the input string, where each word is removed if its length is equal to `k`. The function then joins the remaining words in the list with spaces and returns the resulting string.\n\nThe assertion statement checks that the function correctly removes all words with length `3` from the input string.\n\n### Code:\n```python\ndef remove_length(string, k):\n    return ' '.join([word for word in string.split() if len(word) != k])\n\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\nperson is most value\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `remove_length` takes a string and an integer `k` as input.
