It returns a tuple of two values: the rectangular coordinates (x, y) and the complex number (x+yj). The first value is calculated using the formula x = r * cos(theta), and the second value is calculated using the formula y = r * sin(theta).\n\nThe assert statement checks if the result of the polar_rect function is equal to the expected result. If it is, the assertion passes, and the test is successful. If it is not, the assertion fails, and the test fails.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use Python to solve a real-world problem. The problem asks us to write a function that converts polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates. The function takes two arguments: r and theta, and returns a tuple of two values: the rectangular coordinates (x, y) and the complex number (x+yj). The assert statement checks if the result of the function is equal to the expected result.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use Python to solve a real-world problem.
