The Perrin numbers are defined as follows:\n\n- `P(0) = 3`\n- `P(1) = 0`\n- `P(2) = 2`\n- `P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)` for `n > 2`\n\nThe function `cal_sum` uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers. It first checks if `n` is 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding value. For any other value of `n`, it calls itself recursively with `n-2` and `n-3` as arguments, and returns the sum of the results.\n\nThe assertion `assert cal_sum(9) == 49` checks that the function `cal_sum` returns the correct sum for `n = 9`. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly for this input.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a good example of a recursive function.
