Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of sublists containing a particular element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(list_of_lists, element):\n    count = 0\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        if element in sublist:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of lists and an element as input and returns the number of sublists that contain the element.
