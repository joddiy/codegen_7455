The function uses a list comprehension to flatten the list of lists into a single list of numbers. The list comprehension iterates over each sublist in the input list and adds each item in the sublist to the output list. The output list is then returned.\n\nThe assertion checks that the output of the function `extract_singly` is equal to a set of numbers. The set of numbers is created using the `set` function and the `extract_singly` function is called with a list of lists as input. The assertion checks that the output of the `extract_singly` function is equal to the set of numbers.\n\nThe assertion passes because the output of the `extract_singly` function is equal to the set of numbers.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `extract_singly` takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of numbers.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)])) == set([3, 4, 5, 7, 1])\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_singly(list_of_lists):\n    return [item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `extract_singly` takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of numbers.
