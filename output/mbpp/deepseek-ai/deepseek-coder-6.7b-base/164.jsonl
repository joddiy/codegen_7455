If this condition is satisfied, the count of binary sequences is incremented.\n\nFinally, the function returns the count of binary sequences.\n\nThe assertion statement at the end of the function checks if the count of binary sequences for n=1 is approximately equal to 2.0.\n\n### References:\n\n[1] [Python bin() Function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/bin)\n\n[2] [Python zfill() Method](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/zfill)\n\n[3] [Python isclose() Function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/isclose)\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
