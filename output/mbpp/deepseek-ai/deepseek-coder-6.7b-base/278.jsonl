{"task_id": "Mbpp/591", "completion": "\n```python\ndef swap_List(list):\n    list[0], list[-1] = list[-1], list[0]\n    return list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes a list as an argument and swaps the first and last elements of the list using the ```list[0], list[-1] = list[-1], list[0]``` syntax. The function then returns the modified list.\n\n### Testing:\nTo test the function, we can call it with a list of integers and check that the returned list is the same as the expected list. We can use the assert statement to check that the returned list is equal to the expected list.\n\n### Code:\n```python\ndef swap_List(list):\n    list[0], list[-1] = list[-1], list[0]\n    return list\n\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n### Output:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code swaps the first and last elements of a list and returns the modified list. It can be used to solve the problem described in the instruction.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef swap_List(list):\n    list[0], list[-1] = list[-1], list[0]\n    return list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function takes a list as an argument and swaps the first and last elements of the list using the ```list[0], list[-1] = list[-1], list[0]``` syntax.
