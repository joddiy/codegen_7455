{"task_id": "Mbpp/418", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list):\n    max_list = []\n    for i in list:\n        if len(i) > len(max_list):\n            max_list = i\n    return max_list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the maximum length. The function iterates through the list and compares the length of each list to the length of the current maximum list. If the length of the current list is greater than the length of the current maximum list, the current list is assigned to the maximum list. Finally, the function returns the maximum list.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe function is tested using the assert statement. The assert statement checks if the function returns the expected output for the given input. If the assertion fails, the program will raise an AssertionError.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe function Find_Max takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the maximum length. The function iterates through the list and compares the length of each list to the length of the current maximum list. If the length of the current list is greater than the length of the current maximum list, the current list is assigned to the maximum list. Finally, the function returns the maximum list.\n\n### References:\n\n- [Python Assert Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp)\n- [Python List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)\n- [Python List Length](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_count.asp)\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list):\n    max_list = []\n    for i in list:\n        if len(i) > len(max_list):\n            max_list = i\n    return max_list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the maximum length.
