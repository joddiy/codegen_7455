It returns a new array that is the result of splitting the original array at the `n`th element and adding the first part to the end.\n\nThe function uses the `[start:end]` syntax to extract a subarray from the original array. The `start` index is `n`, and the `end` index is the length of the array. This creates a new array that contains all the elements after the `n`th element.\n\nThe function then concatenates the new array with the first `n` elements of the original array. This creates a new array that contains all the elements of the original array, but in a different order.\n\nThe function returns the new array.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the `assert` statement. The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected result for a given input. If the function returns the expected result, the test passes. If the function returns a different result, the test fails.\n\nThe test passes because the function returns the expected result for the input `[12,10,5,6,52,36]` and `2`.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function is a simple way to split an array at a given index and add the first part to the end. It is a common pattern in programming and can be useful in a variety of situations.\n\nThe function is written in Python and uses the `[start:end]` syntax to extract a subarray from the original array.
