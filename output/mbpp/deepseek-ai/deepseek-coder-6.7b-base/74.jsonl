Then, it loops through all numbers from 1 to the smaller of `a` and `b`. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a common divisor of both `a` and `b`. If it is, it adds `i` to `sum`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `sum`.\n\nThe assertion `assert sum(10, 15) == 6` checks if the function `sum` returns the correct value when given the numbers 10 and 15 as input. If the assertion passes, the function is correct.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum(10,15) == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef sum(a, b):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):\n        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `sum` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns the sum of their common divisors.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
