Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge_sorted_list([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110],[19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154],[24, 26, 54, 48])==[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]\n```\n\n### Response:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):\n    merged_list = list1 + list2 + list3\n    merged_list.sort()\n    return merged_list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function `merge_sorted_list` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list that is the result of merging the three input lists.\n\nThe function first concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator, which creates a new list that contains all the elements of the three input lists.\n\nThe `sort` method is then called on the merged list, which sorts the elements in ascending order.\n\nFinally, the sorted merged list is returned as the result of the function.\n\nThe assertion statement checks if the function correctly merges and sorts the three input lists.
