It iterates through the array and returns the index of the first element that is greater than the value. If the value is greater than all elements in the array, the function returns the length of the array.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe function is tested using the assert statement. The function is called with an array of integers and a value. The result is compared to the expected result. If the result is correct, the test passes. If the result is incorrect, the test fails.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe function is a simple solution to the problem. It is easy to understand and implement. The function is tested using the assert statement. The test passes, indicating that the function is working correctly.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe function is a simple solution to the problem.
