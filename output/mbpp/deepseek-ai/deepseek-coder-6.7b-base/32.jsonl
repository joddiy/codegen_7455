It does this by iterating over each tuple in the list, and checking if all of its elements are divisible by k using the all() function. If they are, the tuple is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.\n\nThis function is efficient because it only iterates over the tuples once, and it does not create any new lists or tuples. It also has a simple and easy-to-understand implementation, which makes it easy to understand and modify.\n\n### Testing:\n\n```python\nassert find_tuples([(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], 6) == [(6, 24, 12)]\n```\n\nThis test case checks that the function returns the correct result for a list of tuples and a divisor of 6. The function should return a list containing the tuple (6, 24, 12), which has all its elements divisible by 6.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem was a good exercise for me because it helped me practice using Python's built-in functions and data structures.
