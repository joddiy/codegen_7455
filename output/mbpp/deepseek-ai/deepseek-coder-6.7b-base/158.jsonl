It returns the length of the third side of the triangle, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the two sides.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns the correct value for the given input. If the assertion fails, the function is not working correctly.\n\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem is a simple one, and the solution is straightforward. The function `otherside_rightangle` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, which are the two sides of the right-angled triangle. It returns the length of the third side of the triangle, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the two sides.\n\nThe assertion checks that the function returns the correct value for the given input.
