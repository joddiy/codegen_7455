{"task_id": "Mbpp/261", "completion": "\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(map(lambda x, y: x / y, t1, t2))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `division_elements` takes in two tuples `t1` and `t2` as arguments. It uses the `map` function to apply the division operation element-wise across the given tuples. The `map` function applies the division operation to each element of the tuples using the `lambda` function `lambda x, y: x / y`. The resulting tuple is returned by the `map` function.\n\nThe `assert` statement checks if the result of the `division_elements` function is equal to the expected result `(2, 2, 2, 3)`. If the assertion passes, the code is correct.\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(map(lambda x, y: x / y, t1, t2))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `division_elements` takes in two tuples `t1` and `t2` as arguments.
