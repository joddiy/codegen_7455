The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. The list comprehension checks if the character is uppercase and if it is, it is added to the list. The list is then joined together into a string and returned.\n\n### Testing:\n\nThe function is tested using the assert statement. The assert statement checks if the function returns the expected output for the given input. If the assertion is true, the test passes. If the assertion is false, the test fails.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe function remove_lowercase takes a string as input and returns a string.
