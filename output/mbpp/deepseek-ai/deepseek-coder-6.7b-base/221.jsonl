{"task_id": "Mbpp/450", "completion": "\n```python\ndef extract_string(lst, n):\n    return [x for x in lst if len(x) > n]\n```\n\n### Test:\n```python\nassert extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)==['practice', 'solution']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `extract_string` takes a list of strings `lst` and an integer `n` as input. It returns a list of strings that have a length greater than `n`.\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `lst` and return a new list containing only the strings that have a length greater than `n`. The `len` function is used to check the length of each string in the input list.\n\nThe assertion `assert extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)==['practice', 'solution']` checks that the function returns the expected output for the given input.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe function `extract_string` is a simple and efficient way to extract strings of a specified length from a list of strings. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the strings that have a length greater than the specified value. This approach is concise and easy to understand, making it a good choice for this problem.\n\nThe assertion `assert extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)==['practice', 'solution']` checks that the function returns the expected output for the given input. This assertion can be used to test the function and ensure that it is working as expected.\n\nOverall, this problem is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a simple problem in Python.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
