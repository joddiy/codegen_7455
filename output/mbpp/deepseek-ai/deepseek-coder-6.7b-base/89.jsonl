{"task_id": "Mbpp/143", "completion": "\n```python\ndef find_lists(tup):\n    count = 0\n    for i in tup:\n        if type(i) == list:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `find_lists` takes a tuple as input and returns the number of lists present in the tuple. The function iterates through each element of the tuple and checks if the element is a list using the `type` function. If the element is a list, the `count` variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`.\n\n### Testing:\nThe function is tested using the `assert` statement. The assertion checks if the function returns the correct number of lists for the given tuple. If the assertion passes, the function is working as expected.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function `find_lists` is a simple function that takes a tuple as input and returns the number of lists present in the tuple. The function is tested using the `assert` statement to ensure that it works as expected.\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find number of lists present in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef find_lists(tup):\n    count = 0\n    for i in tup:\n        if type(i) == list:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `find_lists` takes a tuple as input and returns the number of lists present in the tuple.
