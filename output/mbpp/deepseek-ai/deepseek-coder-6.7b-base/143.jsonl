The function uses a for loop to iterate through the range of n and computes the value of the current term and adds it to the sum. The value of the current term is computed using the formula term = term * (n - i) / (i + 1). The value of the current term is then added to the sum. The value of the current term is then added to the sum. The value of the current term is then added to the sum. The value of the current term is then added to the sum.
