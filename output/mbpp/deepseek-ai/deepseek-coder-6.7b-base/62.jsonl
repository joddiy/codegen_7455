{"task_id": "Mbpp/109", "completion": "\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary, times):\n    binary = binary * times\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(times):\n        if int(binary[i:i+len(binary)//times], 2) % 2 == 1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe function takes two arguments: `binary` and `times`. The `binary` argument is a string representing a binary number, and the `times` argument is an integer representing the number of times the binary number should be rotated.\n\nThe function first multiplies the binary number by the number of times it should be rotated. This is done by concatenating the binary number with itself `times` times.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of binary numbers with an odd value when rotated.\n\nThe function then iterates through the rotated binary number `times` times. For each iteration, it extracts a substring of length `len(binary)//times` from the rotated binary number, starting at the current index. The substring is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function, and the modulo operator is used to check if the integer is odd. If the integer is odd, the `count` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable.\n\n\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
