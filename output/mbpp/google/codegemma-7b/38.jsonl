Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef newman_conway(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the nth number in the newman conway sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the sequence\n    seq = [1, 1]\n    # Loop until the length of the sequence is n\n    while len(seq) < n:\n        # Add the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the sequence\n        seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-2])\n    # Return the nth number in the sequence\n    return seq[n-1]\n```\n"}
