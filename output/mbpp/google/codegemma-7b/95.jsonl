Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef count_char_position(string):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of characters at each position\n    char_count = {}\n    # Iterate through the string\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        # Get the character at the current position\n        char = string[i].lower()\n        # Check if the character is a letter\n        if char.isalpha():\n            # Check if the character is in the alphabet\n            if char in \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\":\n                # Check if the position is in the dictionary\n                if i in char_count:\n                    # If the position is in the dictionary, increment the count\n                    char_count[i] += 1\n                else:\n                    # If the position is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n                    char_count[i] = 1\n    # Return the sum of the counts of characters at each position\n    return sum(char_count.values())\n```\n"}
