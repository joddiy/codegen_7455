The function uses a for loop to iterate through the array and counts the number of times the element appears in the array. If the count is greater than n/2, then the element is the majority element and the function returns True.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef is_majority(arr, n, element):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] == element:\n            count += 1\n    if count > n/2:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThe function is_majority takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array.
