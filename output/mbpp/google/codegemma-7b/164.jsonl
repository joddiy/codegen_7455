Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return count_binary_seq(n-1) * 2 + 1\n```\n"}
