The function iterates over the elements in the list lst and counts the number of times num appears in the list. The count variable is initialized to 0 and is incremented each time num is found in lst. The function returns the count value.\n\nThe code also includes an assertion statement to check if the function works correctly for the given input. The assertion statement checks if the function returns 0 when passed the list [1,2,3] and the number 4. If the assertion fails, the code will raise an AssertionError exception.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and effective way to count the number of occurrences of a number in a list.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    count = 0\n    for i in lst:\n        if i == num:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called frequency that takes two arguments: a list lst and a number num.
