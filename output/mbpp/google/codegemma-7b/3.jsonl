It uses a while loop to compare the corresponding bits of the two numbers, and increments a counter whenever the bits are different. The function returns True if the counter is equal to 1, indicating that the numbers differ at exactly one bit position.\n\nThe assert statement is used to test the function's behavior. It compares the output of the function with the expected result, and raises an AssertionError if they don't match. In this case, the assertion checks that the function returns True when the inputs are 13 and 9, which differ at exactly one bit position.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how to use Python to implement a function that checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    count = 0\n    while num1 > 0 or num2 > 0:\n        bit1 = num1 & 1\n        bit2 = num2 & 1\n        if bit1 != bit2:\n            count += 1\n        num1 >>= 1\n        num2 >>= 1\n    return count == 1\n```\n\nThis function takes two integers as input and returns True if they differ at exactly one bit position, and False otherwise.
