It initializes a variable `smallest` with the first element of the list and then iterates through the list using a for loop. For each number in the list, it checks if it is smaller than the current `smallest` value. If it is, it updates the `smallest` variable with the new smaller value. Finally, it returns the `smallest` value.\n\nThe function is then tested with the assertion `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` which checks if the function correctly finds the smallest number in the list `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]` and returns `1` as the smallest number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef smallest_num(numbers):\n    smallest = numbers[0]\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number < smallest:\n            smallest = number\n    return smallest\n```\n\nThe function `smallest_num(numbers)` takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest number in the list.
