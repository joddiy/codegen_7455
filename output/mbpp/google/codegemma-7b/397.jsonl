{"task_id": "Mbpp/808", "completion": "\nSure! Here's a Python script that defines a function `check_K` that checks if the given tuple contains the k or not. The function takes two arguments: `t` which is a tuple of integers and `k` which is an integer. The function returns `True` if the tuple `t` contains the integer `k` and `False` otherwise.\n\n```python\ndef check_K(t, k):\n    return k in t\n\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\nIn the function definition, we use the `in` operator to check if `k` is present in the tuple `t`. If it is present, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nThe assertion statement at the end of the script checks if the function returns `True` when called with the input `(10, 4, 5, 6, 8)` and `k=6`. If the assertion fails, it raises an `AssertionError` exception.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to check if the given tuples contain the k or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure!
