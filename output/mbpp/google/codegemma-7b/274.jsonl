The `tuple()` function is used to convert the input list into a tuple.\n\nTo test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check whether the function returns the expected output for a given input list.

The function is tested with a list `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]` as input, and the assertion expects the function to return the tuple `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.\n\nIf the function returns the expected output, the assertion passes and the code executes without any errors.
