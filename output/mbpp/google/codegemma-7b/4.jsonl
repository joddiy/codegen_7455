The function uses the `split()` method to split the string into a list of words, and then uses a list comprehension to filter the words that are at least 4 characters long.\n\nTo test the function, you can run the following code:\n```python\nassert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\nThis will raise an assertion error if the function does not return the correct result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef find_char_long(string):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = string.split()\n    # Filter the words that are at least 4 characters long\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]\n    return filtered_words\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `find_char_long` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all words in the string that are at least 4 characters long.
