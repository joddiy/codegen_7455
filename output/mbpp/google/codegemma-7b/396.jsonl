The function iterates through the list using a `for` loop and checks each element to see if it is odd. If an odd number is found, the function returns that number. If no odd numbers are found, the function returns `None`.\n\nThe function is tested with the assertion given in the problem statement, which checks that the function returns the correct value for the input `[1,3,5]`. The assertion passes, indicating that the function works as expected.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and effective solution to the problem of finding the first odd number in a list of numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the first odd number in a given list of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_odd([1,3,5]) == 1\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef first_odd(lst):\n    for i in lst:\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            return i\n    return None\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `first_odd` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the first odd number in the list.
