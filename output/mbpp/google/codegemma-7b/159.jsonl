It iterates through the list and checks each element to see if it is an integer and greater than the current maximum value. If a greater integer is found, it updates the maximum value. The function returns the maximum value found.\n\nThe function is tested with the assertion provided in the instruction. The assertion passes, as the function correctly returns 5 for the given list.\n\nThis function can be useful in cases where you need to find the maximum value in a heterogeneous list that contains both integers and non-integer elements.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the maximum value in a given heterogeneous list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==5\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef max_val(lst):\n    max_val = None\n    for val in lst:\n        if isinstance(val, int) and (max_val is None or val > max_val):\n            max_val = val\n    return max_val\n```\n\nThe function `max_val` takes a list as input and returns the maximum value in the list.
