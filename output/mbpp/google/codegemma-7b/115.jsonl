Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the number of sequences to 0\n    num_sequences = 0\n    # Iterate through all possible sequences of length n\n    for seq in range(1, m+1):\n        # Check if the sequence is valid\n        if seq >= 2*m**(n-1):\n            # If the sequence is valid, add it to the number of sequences\n            num_sequences += 1\n    # Return the number of sequences\n    return num_sequences\n```\n"}
