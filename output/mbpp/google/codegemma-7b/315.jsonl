The function checks whether `cost` is greater than `selling_price`, and if so, returns `False`. If `selling_price` is greater than `cost`, the function returns `False` as well. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.\n\nTo test this code, we can use the `assert` statement. The `assert` statement checks whether the given condition is true. If the condition is true, the `assert` statement does nothing. If the condition is false, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nIn this case, we are checking whether `noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False`. If this condition is true, the `assert` statement does nothing. If it is false, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nSo, we can test this code by running the following code:\n```python\nassert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False\n```\n\nIf the code raises an `AssertionError`, it means that the `noprofit_noloss` function is not working correctly. We can then fix the code and run the `assert` statement again until it passes.\n\nOnce we have fixed the code, we can use it to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. For example, if the cost is 1500 and the selling price is 1200, the function will return `False`, because the selling price is less than the cost.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
