It first flattens the list of lists into a single list using a list comprehension. Then, it iterates through the flattened list and updates a dictionary called freq_dict with the frequency of each element. Finally, it returns the freq_dict as the output.\n\nTo test the function, we can use the assert statement provided in the instruction. Here's how we can use it:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]]) == {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(lists):\n    flat_list = [item for sublist in lists for item in sublist]\n    freq_dict = {}\n    for item in flat_list:\n        if item in freq_dict:\n            freq_dict[item] += 1\n        else:\n            freq_dict[item] = 1\n    return freq_dict\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function called frequency_lists that takes a list of lists as input.
