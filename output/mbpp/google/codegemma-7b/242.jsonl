If the array is empty, it returns 0. The function first checks if the array is empty using the `not arr` condition. If it is empty, it returns 0. If the array is not empty, it uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest values in the array, respectively. It then returns the sum of these two values.\n\nTo test the function, we can use the `assert` statement as specified in the instruction. The assertion checks if the `big_sum` function returns the correct sum for the given array. In this case, the assertion checks if the function returns 4 when the input array is `[1,2,3]`. If the assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError` with a message indicating the failure.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to check the correctness of a function or code.
