{"task_id": "Mbpp/238", "completion": "\nSure, here's a Python script that implements the function to count the number of non-empty substrings of a given string:\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(string):\n    # Initialize the number of substrings to 0\n    num_substrings = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        # Iterate over each character starting from the current character\n        for j in range(i, len(string)):\n            # Increment the number of substrings by 1\n            num_substrings += 1\n\n    # Return the number of substrings\n    return num_substrings\n\n# Test the function\nassert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6\nprint(\"Assertion passed!\")\n```\n\nThis script defines a function called `number_of_substrings` that takes a string as input and returns the number of non-empty substrings of the string. The function iterates over each character in the string and for each character, it iterates over each character starting from the current character. For each substring, the function increments the number of substrings by 1.\n\nThe script also includes a test case to check that the function works correctly. The test case checks that the function returns the correct number of substrings for the string \"abc\". If the test case passes, the script prints \"Assertion passed!\" to the console.\n\nI hope this helps!
