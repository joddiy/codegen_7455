Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Pairs([1,2,1],3) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here's a Python script that implements the function `count_Pairs` that counts the number of possible unordered pairs where both elements are unequal:\n\n```python\ndef count_Pairs(lst, n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if lst[i] != lst[j]:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_Pairs([1,2,1],3) == 2\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `count_Pairs` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input.
