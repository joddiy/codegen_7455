Here's a Python script that checks if a given number is even or not:\n\n```python\ndef is_even(number):\n    return number % 2 == 0\n\nassert is_even(1) == False\n```\n\nIn this script, the `is_even` function takes a number as input and returns `True` if the number is even and `False` otherwise. The `%` operator is used to calculate the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, it means the number is even, so the function returns `True`.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the correct result for the given input. In this case, the assertion checks if the function returns `False` for the input `1`. If the assertion fails, it means the function is not working as expected.\n\nI hope this helps!
