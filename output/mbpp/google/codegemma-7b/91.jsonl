Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef find_solution(a, b, n):\n    # Find a solution to ax + by = n\n    x = 0\n    y = 0\n    while x <= n:\n        if a * x + b * y == n:\n            return (x, y)\n        x += 1\n        y += 1\n    return None\n```\n"}
