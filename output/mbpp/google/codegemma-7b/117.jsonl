Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_charac(\"python programming\")==18\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef count_charac(string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_charac(\"python programming\") == 18\n\nprint(\"The total number of characters in the string is\", count_charac(\"python programming\"))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called count_charac that takes a string as an argument and returns the total number of characters in that string.
