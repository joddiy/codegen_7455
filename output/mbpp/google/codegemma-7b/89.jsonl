Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find number of lists present in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here's a Python script that finds the number of lists present in a given tuple:\n\n```python\ndef find_lists(my_tuple):\n    count = 0\n    for item in my_tuple:\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])))\n```\n\nThis script uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the input tuple `my_tuple`, and checks if each element is a list using the `isinstance()` function.
