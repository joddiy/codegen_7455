Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n### Response:\n```python\ndef union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    \"\"\"Find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order\"\"\"\n    # Convert the tuples to sets\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    # Find the union of the sets\n    set_union = set1.union(set2)\n    # Convert the set to a tuple\n    tuple_union = tuple(set_union)\n    # Sort the tuple\n    tuple_union = tuple(sorted(tuple_union))\n    return tuple_union\n```\n"}
