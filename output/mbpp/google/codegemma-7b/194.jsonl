{"task_id": "Mbpp/418", "completion": "\nSure, here's a Python function that finds the element of a list with the maximum length:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_length_element(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_element = None\n    for element in lst:\n        if len(element) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(element)\n            max_element = element\n    return max_element\n```\n\nYou can test this function using the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert find_max_length_element([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\nThis function first initializes the variables `max_length` and `max_element` to None and 0, respectively. Then, it iterates through each element in the input list and compares its length to the current maximum length. If the length is greater, it updates the maximum length and the corresponding element. Finally, it returns the element with the maximum length.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nCreate a Python script for this problem:\nWrite a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n### Response:\nSure, here's a Python function that finds the element of a list with the maximum length:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_length_element(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_element = None\n    for element in lst:\n        if len(element) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(element)\n            max_element = element\n    return max_element\n```\n\nYou can test this function using the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert find_max_length_element([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\nThis function first initializes the variables `max_length` and `max_element` to None and 0, respectively.
