Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the surface area of a cylinder. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert surfacearea_cylinder(10,5)==942.45\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the surface area of a cylinder:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef surfacearea_cylinder(radius, height):\n    return 2 * math.pi * radius * (radius + height)\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, which is 2\u03c0rh + 2\u03c0r\u00b2 .
