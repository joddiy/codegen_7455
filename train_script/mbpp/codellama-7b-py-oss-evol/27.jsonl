Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether a list contains the given sublist or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])==False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if a sublist exists within a list:\n\n```python\ndef is_sublist(main_list, sublist):\n    return sublist in main_list\n```\n\nYou can use this function to check if a sublist exists within a list.
