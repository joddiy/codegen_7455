{"task_id": "Mbpp/743", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, n):\n    return lst[-n:] + lst[:-n]\n\nassert rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],3)==[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n```\n\nIn this function, `lst[-n:]` gets the last `n` items from the list and `lst[:-n]` gets all the other items.

For example:\n\n```python\nprint(rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 2))  # Output: [9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 0))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 5))  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
