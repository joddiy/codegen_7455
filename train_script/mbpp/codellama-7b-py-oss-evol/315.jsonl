Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss:\n\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(cost, price):\n    if cost == price:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False\n```\n\nThis function works by comparing the cost of the item to its price.
