{"task_id": "Mbpp/222", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that checks if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type:\n\n```python\ndef check_type(t):\n    return len(set(type(i) for i in t)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. A set in Python is a collection type that only contains unique elements. If all elements in the tuple have the same type, the set will contain only one type. If not, the set will contain more than one type, and the function will return False.\n\nYou can test this function with your assertion:\n\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True\n```\n\nThis will pass the assertion, because all elements in the tuple are integers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type:\n\n```python\ndef check_type(t):\n    return len(set(type(i) for i in t)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a set of the types of all elements in the tuple.
