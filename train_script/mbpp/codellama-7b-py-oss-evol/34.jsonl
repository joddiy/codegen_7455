Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the length of the word is odd or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert word_len(\"Hadoop\") == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that checks if the length of a word is odd or not:\n\n```python\ndef word_len(word):\n    return len(word) % 2 != 0\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert word_len(\"Hadoop\") == False\n```\n\nThis will pass because the length of \"Hadoop\" is 6, which is an even number.
