For each parent node, it checks if the parent node is smaller than its left child and, if it has a right child, if the parent node is smaller than its right child. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, the function returns `False` immediately, indicating that the array does not represent a min heap. If the function completes the iteration without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the array represents a min heap.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if a given array represents a min heap.\n\n```python\ndef check_min_heap(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n//2):\n        if arr[i] > arr[2*i+1]:\n            return False\n        if 2*i+2 < n:\n            if arr[i] > arr[2*i+2]:\n                return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the array from the first parent node (at index `i = 0`) to the last node.
