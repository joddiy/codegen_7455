At the end, it returns this maximum length.\n\nThe provided assertion checks if the function `Find_Max_Length` returns the correct length of the longest sublist in the list `[[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]`. The longest sublist in this list is `[5,6,7,8]` with length 4, so the function should return 4.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    for sublist in lst:\n        max_length = max(max_length, len(sublist))\n    return max_length\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each sublist in the input list and keeps track of the maximum length it has seen so far.
