Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether all dictionaries in a list are empty or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert empty_dit([{},{},{}])==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if all dictionaries in a list are empty:\n\n```python\ndef empty_dict(lst):\n    return all(not d for d in lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `all` function, which returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty).
