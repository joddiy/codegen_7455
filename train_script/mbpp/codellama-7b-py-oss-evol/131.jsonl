If the divisor is zero, it returns 0 to avoid a division by zero error. The result is then converted back into a tuple using the `tuple` function.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThis will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that performs the requested operation:\n\n```python\ndef division_elements(tup1, tup2):\n    return tuple(a / b if b != 0 else 0 for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples simultaneously, then uses a list comprehension to perform the division operation.
