{"task_id": "Mbpp/312", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that defines a function `volume_cone` to calculate the volume of a cone.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cone(radius, height):\n    return (1/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `radius` and `height`. It calculates the volume of the cone using the formula `1/3 * \u03c0 * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius of the base of the cone and `h` is the height of the cone.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function `volume_cone` returns a value that is close to the expected value (with a relative tolerance of 0.001). The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected volume.\n\nYou can run the assertion to check if the function is working correctly:\n\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means that the function `volume_cone` is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
