Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum value in a given heterogeneous list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==5\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_val(lst):\n    return max(lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `max()` function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.
