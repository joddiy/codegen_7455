Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters:\n\n```python\ndef text_match_two_three(s):\n    return s.startswith('a') and (s[1:].startswith('bb') or s[1:].startswith('bbb'))\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the string starts with 'a'.
