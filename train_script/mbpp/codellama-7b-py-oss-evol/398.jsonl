Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tup1, tup2):\n    return all(x < y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `zip` function to pair up the elements of the two tuples, and then the `all` function to check if all of the conditions are true.
