At that point, the previous power is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n, so we return 2 to the power of that previous power minus 1.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\nThis should return True, indicating that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n):\n    power = 0\n    while (2 ** power) <= n:\n        power += 1\n    return 2 ** (power - 1)\n```\n\nThis function works by starting with a power of 2 of 0 (which is 1), and then incrementing the power until the 2 to the power of the current power is greater than n.
