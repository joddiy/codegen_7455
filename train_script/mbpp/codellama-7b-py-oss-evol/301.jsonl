Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to divide two lists element wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    return [a/b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`, and then uses a list comprehension to divide each pair.
