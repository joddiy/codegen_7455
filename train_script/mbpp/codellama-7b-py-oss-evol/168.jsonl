Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    # Create a list to store the products\n    products = []\n\n    # Iterate over the lists\n    for num1 in list1:\n        for num2 in list2:\n            # Multiply the numbers and add to the list\n            products.append(num1 * num2)\n\n    # Sort the list in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Return the n largest products\n    return products[:n]\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each pair of numbers from the two lists, multiplying them together, and adding the product to a list.
