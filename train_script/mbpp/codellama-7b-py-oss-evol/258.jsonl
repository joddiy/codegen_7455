If the two are identical, the list is sorted.\n\nYou can use this function to check if a list is sorted by calling it with the list as an argument:\n\n```python\nprint(issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17]))  # This will print: True\n```\n\nThis will return `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if a list is sorted:\n\n```python\ndef issort_list(lst):\n    return lst == sorted(lst)\n```\n\nThis function works by comparing the original list to a sorted version of the list.
