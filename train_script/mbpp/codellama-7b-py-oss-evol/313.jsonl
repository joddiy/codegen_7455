Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of xor of all pairs of numbers in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef pair_xor_Sum(lst, x):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            sum += lst[i] ^ lst[j]\n    return sum ^ x\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the list and adding the XOR of each pair to a running total.
