Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth octagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_octagonal(5) == 65\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_octagonal(n):\n    return n*(5*n-3)//2\n\nassert is_octagonal(5) == 65\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the formula for the nth octagonal number, which is `n*(5*n-3)//2`.
