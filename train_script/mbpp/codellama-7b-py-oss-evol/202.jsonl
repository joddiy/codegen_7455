{"task_id": "Mbpp/427", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef change_date_format(date):\n    return date[8:10] + '-' + date[5:7] + '-' + date[:4]\n\nassert change_date_format(\"2026-01-02\") == '02-01-2026'\n```\n\nThis function takes a date in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\" and returns it in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\". It does this by slicing the string at the appropriate indices. The slicing syntax in Python is `string[start:end]` which returns a substring from index `start` up to but not including `end`. The indices are zero-based, so `string[8:10]` gets the last two characters of the string (the day), `string[5:7]` gets the next two characters (the month), and `string[:4]` gets the first four characters (the year).", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert a date of yyyy-mm-dd format to dd-mm-yyyy format. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert change_date_format(\"2026-01-02\") == '02-01-2026'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef change_date_format(date):\n    return date[8:10] + '-' + date[5:7] + '-' + date[:4]\n\nassert change_date_format(\"2026-01-02\") == '02-01-2026'\n```\n\nThis function takes a date in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\" and returns it in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\".
