Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s):\n    if s == s[::-1]:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s == s[i:] + s[:i]:\n                return i\n        return len(s)\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if the string is the same as its reverse.
