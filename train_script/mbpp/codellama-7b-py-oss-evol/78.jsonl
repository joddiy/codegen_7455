Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    from collections import Counter\n    counter = Counter(lst)\n    max_count = max(list(counter.values()))\n    max_items = [k for k, v in counter.items() if v == max_count]\n    return max_items\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each item in the list.
