Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    return set(list1) & set(list2)\n```\n\nThis function works by converting both lists to sets and then using the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets.
