Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort a dictionary by value. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sort_counter({'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87})==[('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that sorts a dictionary by value:\n\n```python\ndef sort_counter(counter):\n    return sorted(counter.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nassert sort_counter({'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87})==[('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `sort_counter` that takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary, sorted by the value in ascending order.
