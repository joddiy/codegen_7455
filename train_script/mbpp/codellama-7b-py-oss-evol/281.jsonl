Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(lst):\n    evens = [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]\n    odds = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]\n    return abs(evens[0] - odds[0])\n```\n\nThis function first filters the list to separate the even and odd numbers.
