Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sum(get_total_number_of_sequences(i, n - 1) for i in range(2, m + 1, 2))\n\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)` that calculates the number of possible sequences of length `n` with the given constraints.
