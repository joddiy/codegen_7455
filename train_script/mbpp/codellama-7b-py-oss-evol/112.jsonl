Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that sets all even bits of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    return n | (n >> 1)\n```\n\nThis function works by shifting the bits of the number to the right by one place (using the `>>` operator), and then using the `|` operator to perform a bitwise OR operation between the original number and the shifted number.
