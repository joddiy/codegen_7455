This function works by checking if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is, then the number is not prime. If it is not, then the number is prime.\n\nThe main function `count_Primes_nums` then uses a generator expression to generate a sequence of booleans indicating whether each number less than `n` is prime. It then uses the built-in `sum` function to count the number of `True` values in this sequence, which corresponds to the number of primes less than `n`.\n\nThe assertion `assert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2` checks that the function works correctly for the input 5.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\n    def is_prime(num):\n        if num < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    return sum(is_prime(i) for i in range(n))\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime.
