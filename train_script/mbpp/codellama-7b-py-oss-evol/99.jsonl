Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_range_list(lst, start, end):\n    return sum(lst[start:end+1])\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers and two indices as input.
