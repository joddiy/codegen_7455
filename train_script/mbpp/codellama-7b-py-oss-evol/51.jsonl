Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(lists):\n    freq = {}\n    for sublist in lists:\n        for item in sublist:\n            if item in freq:\n                freq[item] += 1\n            else:\n                freq[item] = 1\n    return freq\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each sublist in the input list, and then iterating over each item in the sublist.
