Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that generates the nth number in the Newman Conway sequence.\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        sequence = [0, 1, 1]\n        for i in range(3, n+1):\n            sequence.append(sequence[sequence[i-1]] + sequence[i-sequence[i-1]])\n        return sequence[n]\n```\n\nThis function works by maintaining a list of the sequence up to the current number.
