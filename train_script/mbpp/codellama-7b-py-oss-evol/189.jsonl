Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_val(lst):\n    return min(lst, key=lambda x: (str(x).lower(), x) if not isinstance(x, str) else (x, float('inf')))\n\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the built-in `min` function with a custom key function.
