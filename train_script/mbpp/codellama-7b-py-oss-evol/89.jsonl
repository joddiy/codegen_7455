Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find number of lists present in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_lists(tup):\n    return len(tup)\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple as input and returns the number of lists present in the tuple.
