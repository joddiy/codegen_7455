Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    return lst.count(num)\n```\n\nThis function takes a list and a number as input.
