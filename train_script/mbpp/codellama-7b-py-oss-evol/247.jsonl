Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert difference(3) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef difference(n):\n    sum_of_cubes = sum([i**3 for i in range(1, n+1)])\n    sum_of_numbers = sum([i for i in range(1, n+1)])\n    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers\n```\n\nThis function works by first calculating the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers using a list comprehension, then calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers in a similar way.
