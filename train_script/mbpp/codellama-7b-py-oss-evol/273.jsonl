Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to split a list at the nth eelment and add the first part to the end. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert split_Arr([12,10,5,6,52,36],2) == [5,6,52,36,12,10]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\n    return arr[n:] + arr[:n]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list and a number as input.
