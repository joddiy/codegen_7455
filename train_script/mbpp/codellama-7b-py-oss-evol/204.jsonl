The `min` function is used to find the minimum of a pair of numbers, and `tuple` is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple.\n\nThe function can be tested with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\nThis will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(min(a, b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the two tuples, and then uses a generator expression to compute the elementwise minimum of each pair.
