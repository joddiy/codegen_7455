We then define a function `multiply_num` that takes a list of numbers as input. Inside the function, we initialize a variable `product` to 1. We then iterate over each number in the input list, multiplying `product` by the current number. After the loop finishes, we return `product` divided by the length of the input list.\n\nFinally, we use the `assert` statement to check if the function `multiply_num` returns the expected value, within a small tolerance of error.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef multiply_num(lst):\n    product = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        product *= num\n    return product / len(lst)\n\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, we first import the `math` module, which contains various mathematical functions.
