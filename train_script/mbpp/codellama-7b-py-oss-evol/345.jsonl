{"task_id": "Mbpp/746", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that calculates the area of a sector:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sector_area(radius, angle):\n    if angle > 360:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return (angle/360) * math.pi * radius**2\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the angle is greater than 360 degrees. If it is, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the area of the sector by dividing the angle by 360 (to get the proportion of the circle that the sector represents), multiplying that by pi (the constant that represents a full circle), and then multiplying that by the square of the radius (to get the area of the circle).\n\nThe assertion you provided tests this function with a radius of 4 and an angle of 45 degrees. The area of a circle with radius 4 is 196.858, and the proportion of that area that is covered by a sector of 45 degrees is 45/360 = 0.111111. So the area of the sector is 0.111111 * 196.858 = 22.967846.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find area of a sector. The function takes the radius and angle as inputs. Function should return None if the angle is larger than 360 degrees. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sector_area(4,45)==6.283185307179586\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the area of a sector:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sector_area(radius, angle):\n    if angle > 360:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return (angle/360) * math.pi * radius**2\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the angle is greater than 360 degrees.
