Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to merge three dictionaries into a single dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge_dictionaries_three({ \"R\": \"Red\", \"B\": \"Black\", \"P\": \"Pink\" }, { \"G\": \"Green\", \"W\": \"White\" },{ \"O\": \"Orange\", \"W\": \"White\", \"B\": \"Black\" })=={'B': 'Black', 'R': 'Red', 'P': 'Pink', 'G': 'Green', 'W': 'White', 'O': 'Orange'}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that merges three dictionaries into a single dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    merged_dict.update(dict3)\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\nThe `update` method is used to add key-value pairs from the second dictionary to the first one.
