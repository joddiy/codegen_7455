Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert start_withp([\"Python PHP\", \"Java JavaScript\", \"c c++\"])==('Python', 'PHP')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef start_withp(words):\n    result = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word.split()[0].lower() == 'p':\n            result.extend(word.split())\n    return tuple(result[:2])\n```\n\nThis function goes through each word in the list.
