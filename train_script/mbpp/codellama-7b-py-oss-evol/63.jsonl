Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the common elements in given nested lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_list):\n    # Flatten the nested list\n    flat_list = [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]\n    # Use set to find common elements\n    common_elements = set(flat_list)\n    return common_elements\n\nassert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])\n```\n\nThis function works by first flattening the nested list into a single list, then using a set to find the common elements.
