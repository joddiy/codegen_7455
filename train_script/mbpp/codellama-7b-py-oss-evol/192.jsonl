Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether any value in a sequence exists in a sequence or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks whether any value in the first sequence exists in the second sequence:\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    for i in seq1:\n        if i in seq2:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each value in the first sequence and checking if it exists in the second sequence.
