Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to add a dictionary to the tuple. The output should be a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict):\n    return tup + (dict,)\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple and a dictionary as input, and returns a new tuple that includes the original tuple and the dictionary.
