Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    We say that an element is common for lists l1, l2, l3 if it appears in all three lists under the same index. Write a function to find common elements from three lists. The function should return a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    common_elements = []\n    for i in range(len(l1)):\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            common_elements.append(l1[i])\n    return common_elements\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the elements of the first list and checks if the element at the same index in the other two lists is equal.
