Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Extract(lst):\n    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list.
