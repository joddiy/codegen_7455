Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of divisors of a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to n and checking if n is divisible by the current number.
