{"task_id": "Mbpp/808", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_K(tup, k):\n    return k in tup\n```\n\nThis function uses the `in` keyword in Python to check if the value `k` is in the tuple `tup`. If `k` is in `tup`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, because 6 is in the tuple (10, 4, 5, 6, 8).", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given tuples contain the k or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_K(tup, k):\n    return k in tup\n```\n\nThis function uses the `in` keyword in Python to check if the value `k` is in the tuple `tup`.
