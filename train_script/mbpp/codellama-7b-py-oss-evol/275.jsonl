Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the difference between largest and smallest value in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert big_diff([1,2,3,4]) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef big_diff(lst):\n    return max(lst) - min(lst)\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert big_diff([1,2,3,4]) == 3\n```\n\nThis function works by using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions in Python, which return the largest and smallest values in a list, respectively.
