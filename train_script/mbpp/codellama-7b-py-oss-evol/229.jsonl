Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_uppercase('cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs') == 'cstyoravoitshos'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes uppercase substrings from a given string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_uppercase(s):\n    return ''.join([c for c in s if c.islower() or c.isdigit() or c.isspace()])\n\nassert remove_uppercase('cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs') == 'cstyoravoitshos'\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string.
