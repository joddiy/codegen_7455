Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(lst):\n    even_product = 1\n    odd_product = 1\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_product *= num\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_product *= num\n            odd_count += 1\n    if even_count > 0:\n        return even_product\n    elif odd_count > 0:\n        return odd_product\n    else:\n        return None\n\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over each number in the list.
