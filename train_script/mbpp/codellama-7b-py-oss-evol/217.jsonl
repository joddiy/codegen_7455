Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to perform index wise multiplication of tuple elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that performs the requested operation:\n\n```python\ndef index_multiplication(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(tuple(a*b for a, b in zip(t1[i], t2[i])) for i in range(len(t1)))\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the tuples at the same index, multiplying them together, and then packing the results back into a tuple.
