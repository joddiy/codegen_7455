Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert snake_to_camel('python_program')=='PythonProgram'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that converts a snake case string to camel case:\n\n```python\ndef snake_to_camel(snake_str):\n    components = snake_str.split('_')\n    return ''.join(x.title() for x in components)\n\nassert snake_to_camel('python_program')=='PythonProgram'\n```\n\nIn this function, we first split the snake case string into a list of words using the `_` as the delimiter.
