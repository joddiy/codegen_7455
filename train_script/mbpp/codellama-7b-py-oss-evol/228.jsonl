For example:\n\n```python\nprint(rectangle_area(10, 20))  # Output: 200\n```\n\nThis function satisfies the given assertion because it correctly calculates the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the area of a rectangle. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert rectangle_area(10,20)==200\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that calculates the area of a rectangle:\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find the area of a rectangle by providing the length and width as arguments.
