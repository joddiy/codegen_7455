Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_expression(\"{()}[{}]\") == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if the given expression is balanced or not.\n\n```python\ndef check_expression(expression):\n    stack = []\n    mapping = {\")\": \"(\", \"]\": \"[\", \"}\": \"{\"}\n    for char in expression:\n        if char in mapping.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in mapping.keys():\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != mapping[char]:\n                return False\n    return not stack\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the expression.
