{"task_id": "Mbpp/471", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product = (product * num) % n\n    return product\n```\n\nThis function takes an array and a number as input. It initializes a variable `product` to 1. Then, it iterates over each number in the array, multiplying `product` by the current number and taking the remainder when dividing by `n`. This effectively calculates the product of the array elements modulo `n`. The function then returns this product.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function `find_remainder` returns the expected result for the given input. If the function returns the correct result, the assertion will pass. If the function returns a different result, the assertion will fail, indicating that the function is not working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the product of the array multiplication modulo n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product = (product * num) % n\n    return product\n```\n\nThis function takes an array and a number as input.
