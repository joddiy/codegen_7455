The third argument to the `replace` method is the count of occurrences to replace. If the count is 1, it replaces the first occurrence, and if it is -1, it replaces the last occurrence.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s, c):\n    if s.count(c) < 2:\n        return s\n    else:\n        return s.replace(c, '', 1).replace(c, '', -1)\n\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\nIn this function, the `replace` method is used to replace the first and last occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s` with an empty string.
