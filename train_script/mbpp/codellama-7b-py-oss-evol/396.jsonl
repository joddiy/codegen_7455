Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the first odd number in a given list of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_odd([1,3,5]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef first_odd(lst):\n    for num in lst:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            return num\n    return None\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list of numbers and returns the first odd number it encounters.
