A number is a lucid number if it is not divisible by any number less than itself. We use the `all()` function and a generator expression to check this condition for each number. If the number is a lucid number, it is added to the `ludic` list. Finally, the function returns the `ludic` list.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function `get_ludic(10)` returns the expected list of lucid numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    ludic = []\n    for num in range(1, n+1):\n        if all(num%i!=0 for i in range(2, num)):\n            ludic.append(num)\n    return ludic\n\nassert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `get_ludic(n)` that iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if they are a lucid number.
