Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\n    binary_string = binary_string[rotations:] + binary_string[:rotations]\n    odd_count = sum(int(bit) for bit in binary_string)\n    return odd_count\n\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\nThis function works by first rotating the binary string by the given number of rotations.
