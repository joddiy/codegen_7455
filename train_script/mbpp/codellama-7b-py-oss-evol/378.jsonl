{"task_id": "Mbpp/786", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, val):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < val:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\n\nThis function uses binary search to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted array. It starts by setting `left` to the index of the first element and `right` to the index of the last element. It then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index `mid` and compares the value at `mid` with the specified value `val`. If the value at `mid` is less than `val`, it sets `left` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, it sets `right` to `mid`. The loop continues until `left` is less than or equal to `right`. The function then returns `left`, which is the index of the right insertion point.\n\nThe function satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, val):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < val:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\n\nThis function uses binary search to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted array.
