Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    return [i**2 for i in range(start, end+1) if i**2 == int(i**2)]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of perfect squares between the given start and end numbers.
