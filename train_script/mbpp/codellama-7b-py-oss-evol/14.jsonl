Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if a number is a woodball number or not.
