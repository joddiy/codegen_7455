{"task_id": "Mbpp/792", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that counts the number of lists in a given list of lists:\n\n```python\ndef count_list(lst):\n    return len(lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `len` function to count the number of elements in the given list. Since the `len` function returns the number of elements in an iterable, it will work for any sequence type, including lists.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\nThis assertion will pass if the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of lists in a given number of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that counts the number of lists in a given list of lists:\n\n```python\ndef count_list(lst):\n    return len(lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `len` function to count the number of elements in the given list.
