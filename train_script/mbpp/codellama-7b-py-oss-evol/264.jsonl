Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Sub_Array([1,4,3,5],[1,2]) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks whether a list is a sublist of another or not.\n\n```python\ndef is_Sub_Array(main_list, sub_list):\n    return sub_list in main_list\n```\n\nYou can use this function to check whether a list is a sublist of another or not.
