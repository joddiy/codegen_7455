Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Split(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the numbers in the input list.
