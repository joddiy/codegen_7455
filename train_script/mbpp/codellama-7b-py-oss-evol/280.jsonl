Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")==('216.8.94.196')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes leading zeroes from an IP address:\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip):\n    return '.'.join(str(int(i)) for i in ip.split('.'))\n\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")=='216.8.94.196'\n```\n\nIn this function, we first split the IP address into its components using the '.' as the delimiter.
