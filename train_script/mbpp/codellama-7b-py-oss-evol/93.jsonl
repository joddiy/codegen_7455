Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate the sum (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2, for instance n + (n-2) + (n-4)... (until n-x =< 0). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_series(6) == 12\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the sum as described in the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):\n        total += n - 2 * i\n    return total\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating from 0 to n // 2 (the largest integer less than or equal to n / 2), and for each iteration, it adds (n - 2 * i) to the total.
