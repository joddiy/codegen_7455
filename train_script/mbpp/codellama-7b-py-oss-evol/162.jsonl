Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert flatten_list([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])==[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that can flatten a nested list:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    result = []\n    for i in nested_list:\n        if isinstance(i, list):\n            result.extend(flatten_list(i))\n        else:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each item in the given list.
