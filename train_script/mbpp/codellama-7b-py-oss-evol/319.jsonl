Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth nonagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_nonagonal(10) == 325\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that generates the nth nonagonal number:\n\n```python\ndef is_nonagonal(n):\n    return n*(7*n-5)//2\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the nth nonagonal number, which is n(7n-5)/2.
