Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef maximize_elements(t1, t2):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(t1)):\n        if t1[i][0] > t2[i][0]:\n            result.append(t1[i])\n        elif t1[i][0] < t2[i][0]:\n            result.append(t2[i])\n        else:\n            if t1[i][1] > t2[i][1]:\n                result.append(t1[i])\n            else:\n                result.append(t2[i])\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis function goes through each tuple in the input and checks if the first element of the tuple in the first input is greater than the first element of the tuple in the second input.
