Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    max_ending_here = max_ending_so_far = 0\n    start = end = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:\n            max_ending_here = max_ending_here + arr[i]\n            if max_ending_here > max_ending_so_far:\n                max_ending_so_far = max_ending_here\n                start = end = i\n        else:\n            max_ending_here = 0\n            end = i\n    return max_ending_so_far + arr[start]\n\nassert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at each index.
