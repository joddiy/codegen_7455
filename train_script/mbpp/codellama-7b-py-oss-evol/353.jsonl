Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        return None\n    smallest = second_smallest = float('inf')\n    for n in numbers:\n        if n <= smallest:\n            smallest, second_smallest = n, smallest\n        elif n < second_smallest:\n            second_smallest = n\n    return second_smallest\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the list of numbers. If the current number is less than or equal to the current smallest number, it updates both the smallest and second smallest numbers. If the current number is greater than the smallest number but less than the second smallest number, it updates the second smallest number.\n\nThe function returns `None` if the list has less than 2 elements."}
