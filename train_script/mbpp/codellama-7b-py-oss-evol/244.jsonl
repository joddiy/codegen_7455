Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_lowercase(\"PYTHon\")==('PYTH')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes all lowercase substrings from a given string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_lowercase(s):\n    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if not s[i].islower())\n\nassert remove_lowercase(\"PYTHon\") == \"PYTH\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string, and if the character is not lowercase (i.e., it is uppercase or a special character), it is added to the result.
