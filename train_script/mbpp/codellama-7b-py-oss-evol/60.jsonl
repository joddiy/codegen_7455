Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to append the given list to the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef add_lists(lst, tup):\n    return tup + tuple(lst)\n\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: a list and a tuple.
