Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert the given tuple to a key-value dictionary using adjacent elements. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-convert-tuple-to-adjacent-pair-dictionary/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef tuple_to_dict(t):\n    return dict(zip(t[::2], t[1::2]))\n\nassert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}\n```\n\nThis function uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the tuple.
