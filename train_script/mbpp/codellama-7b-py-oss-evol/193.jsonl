Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find a pair with highest product from a given array of integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Product([1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4]) == (7,8)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    arr.sort()\n    return (arr[-1], arr[-2])\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the array in ascending order.
