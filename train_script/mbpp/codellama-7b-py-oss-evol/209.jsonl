{"task_id": "Mbpp/435", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit(n):\n    return n % 10\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the last digit of `n` by using the modulus operator `%`. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of `n` by 10. This is because the last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert last_Digit(123) == 3\n```\n\nIf the assertion is true, the function is working correctly. If it is not, the function is not working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the last digit of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit(123) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit(n):\n    return n % 10\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the last digit of `n` by using the modulus operator `%`.
