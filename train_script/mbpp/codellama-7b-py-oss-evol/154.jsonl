Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the largest sum of a contiguous array in the modified array which is formed by repeating the given array k times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, k, m):\n    # Repeat the array k times\n    repeated_arr = arr * k\n\n    # Initialize the maximum sum and current sum\n    max_sum = current_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the repeated array\n    for num in repeated_arr:\n        # Add the number to the current sum\n        current_sum += num\n\n        # If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum, update the maximum sum\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n\n        # If the current sum is less than zero, reset the current sum\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n\n    # Return the maximum sum\n    return max_sum\n\n# Test the function\nassert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30\n```\n\nThis script works by first repeating the input array k times to create the modified array.
