Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a sphere. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that defines a function to calculate the volume of a sphere:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_sphere(radius):\n    return (4/3) * math.pi * radius**3\n\n# Test the function with the provided assertion\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `volume_sphere` that takes the radius of a sphere as input and returns its volume.
