For each `i`, it calculates `j` as the square root of the remainder `n - i * i`. If `i * i + j * j == n`, then `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares, and the function returns `True`. If no such `i` and `j` are found, the function returns `False`.\n\nThis function satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\nThis assertion passes, because 5 can indeed be represented as the difference of two squares: 4 and 1.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks whether a given number can be represented as the difference of two squares:\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        j = int((n - i * i) ** 0.5)\n        if i * i + j * j == n:\n            return True\n        i += 1\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible values of `i` such that `i * i <= n`.
