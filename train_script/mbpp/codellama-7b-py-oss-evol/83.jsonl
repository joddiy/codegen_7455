Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef zero_count(arr):\n    zero_count = sum(x == 0 for x in arr)\n    non_zero_count = sum(x != 0 for x in arr)\n    return zero_count / non_zero_count\n\nassert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nIn this script, we first count the number of zeros and non-zeros in the array using list comprehensions.
