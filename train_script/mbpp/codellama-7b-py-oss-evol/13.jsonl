A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. When we convert the list to a set, any duplicate elements are automatically removed. If the lengths of the list and the set are different, that means there were duplicate elements in the list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert test_duplicate([1,2,3,4,5])==False\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, because the list [1,2,3,4,5] does not contain any duplicate elements.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert test_duplicate(([1,2,3,4,5]))==False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that checks if there are any duplicate elements in a list:\n\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(lst):\n    return len(lst) != len(set(lst))\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the list to a set.
