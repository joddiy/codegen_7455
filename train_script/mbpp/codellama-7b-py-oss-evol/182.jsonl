Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to compute the sum of digits of each number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_of_digits([10,2,56])==14\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(lst):\n    return sum(int(digit) for number in lst for digit in str(number))\n\nassert sum_of_digits([10,2,56])==14\n```\n\nIn this function, we use a generator expression to convert each number in the list to a string, then iterate over each digit in the string.
