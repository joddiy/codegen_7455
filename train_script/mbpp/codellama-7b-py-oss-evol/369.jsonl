Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers:\n\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list and checks if the index is odd and the value at that index is even.
