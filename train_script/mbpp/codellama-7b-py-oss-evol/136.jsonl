Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):\n        sum += i**2\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first 2n odd numbers (since there are n odd numbers between 1 and 2n), squaring each one, and adding it to the running total.
