Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_length(lst):\n    max_len = max(len(sub_lst) for sub_lst in lst)\n    return (max_len, [item for sub_lst in lst for item in sub_lst if len(sub_lst) == max_len])\n\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the maximum length of sublists in the input list using a generator expression and the built-in `max` function.
