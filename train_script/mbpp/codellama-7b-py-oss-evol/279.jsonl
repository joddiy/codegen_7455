Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_product(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        sum += (i+1)*(i+2)\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients.
