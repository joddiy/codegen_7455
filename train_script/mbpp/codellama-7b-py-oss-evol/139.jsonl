Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst):\n    return sum(i for i in lst[::2] if i % 2 == 0)\n```\n\nThis function works by using Python's list slicing to get every other element from the list (i.e., the elements at even positions), and then it uses a generator expression to filter out the odd numbers.
