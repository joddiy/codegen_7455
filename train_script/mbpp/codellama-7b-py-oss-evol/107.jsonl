Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef re_arrange_array(arr, n):\n    neg = []\n    pos = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] < 0:\n            neg.append(arr[i])\n        else:\n            pos.append(arr[i])\n    return neg + pos\n\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\nThis script works by first separating the negative and positive elements into two separate lists. It then concatenates the two lists to get the final result. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array."}
