{"task_id": "Mbpp/6", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    # Convert the numbers to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    bin1 = bin(num1)[2:]\n    bin2 = bin(num2)[2:]\n\n    # If the lengths of the binary strings are not equal, they differ at more than one bit position\n    if len(bin1) != len(bin2):\n        return False\n\n    # Check each bit in the binary strings\n    for b1, b2 in zip(bin1, bin2):\n        if b1 != b2:\n            return True\n\n    # If no differences found, the numbers differ at no more than one bit position\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the input numbers to binary, removing the '0b' prefix, and comparing the binary strings. If the lengths of the binary strings are not equal, the numbers differ at more than one bit position. If the lengths are equal, the function checks each bit in the binary strings. If it finds two bits that are different, it returns True, indicating that the numbers differ at one bit position only. If it checks all the bits and finds no differences, it returns False, indicating that the numbers differ at no more than one bit position.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    # Convert the numbers to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    bin1 = bin(num1)[2:]\n    bin2 = bin(num2)[2:]\n\n    # If the lengths of the binary strings are not equal, they differ at more than one bit position\n    if len(bin1) != len(bin2):\n        return False\n\n    # Check each bit in the binary strings\n    for b1, b2 in zip(bin1, bin2):\n        if b1 != b2:\n            return True\n\n    # If no differences found, the numbers differ at no more than one bit position\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the input numbers to binary, removing the '0b' prefix, and comparing the binary strings.
