{"task_id": "Mbpp/804", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that checks whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not:\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(lst):\n    product = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        product *= num\n    return product % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis function works by initializing a variable `product` to 1. It then multiplies `product` by each number in the input list. If the product is even, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.\n\nThe function uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the product is even. If the product modulo 2 equals 0, the product is even. If it's not, the product is odd.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, because the product of 1, 2, and 3 is 6, which is an even number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not:\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(lst):\n    product = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        product *= num\n    return product % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis function works by initializing a variable `product` to 1.
