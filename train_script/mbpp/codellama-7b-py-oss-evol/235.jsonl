{"task_id": "Mbpp/468", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    max_so_far = arr[0]\n    min_so_far = arr[0]\n    max_ending_here = arr[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] > max_ending_here:\n            max_ending_here = arr[i]\n        elif arr[i] < max_ending_here:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, arr[i])\n\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n    return max(max_so_far * min_so_far, max_so_far * (n - max_so_far.bit_length()))\n\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum and minimum values seen so far. The maximum product is either the product of the maximum and minimum values, or the product of the maximum value and the difference between the maximum value and the next power of 2. This is because the product of the maximum and minimum values is always at least as large as the product of the maximum and the next power of 2.\n\nThe bit_length method is used to get the number of bits in the binary representation of the number. This is used to calculate the next power of 2.\n\nThe time complexity of this script is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are storing the maximum and minimum values seen so far.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    max_so_far = arr[0]\n    min_so_far = arr[0]\n    max_ending_here = arr[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] > max_ending_here:\n            max_ending_here = arr[i]\n        elif arr[i] < max_ending_here:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, arr[i])\n\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n    return max(max_so_far * min_so_far, max_so_far * (n - max_so_far.bit_length()))\n\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum and minimum values seen so far.
