For each number, it checks if all digits of the number are divisible by the number itself. If they are, it adds the number to the result list.\n\nThe `all` function is used to check if all elements in the generator expression are true. The generator expression checks if each digit of the number is divisible by the number itself.\n\nThe `int(digit)` function is used to convert the digit to an integer, because the `%` operator does not work with strings.\n\nThe `str(num)` function is used to convert the number to a string, so that we can iterate over its digits.\n\nThe `+1` in `range(startnum, endnum+1)` is to include `endnum` in the range.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find numbers within a given range from startnum ti endnum where every number is divisible by every digit it contains. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/lambda/python-lambda-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n    result = []\n    for num in range(startnum, endnum+1):\n        if all(int(digit)%num == 0 for digit in str(num)):\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each number in the given range.
