If it is, it increments the inversion count.\n\nThe provided assertion checks this function with an array [1,20,6,4,5] and expects the function to return 5, which is the correct number of inversions in this array.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count inversions in an array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Inv_Count([1,20,6,4,5]) == 5\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that counts the number of inversions in an array:\n\n```python\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    inv_count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the array and for each pair of elements, it checks if the first element is greater than the second.
