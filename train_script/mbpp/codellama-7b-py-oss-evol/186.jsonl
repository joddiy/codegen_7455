Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_Parity(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if `n` is even by using the modulus operator `%`.
