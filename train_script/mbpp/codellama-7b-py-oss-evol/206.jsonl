The `in` operator is used to check if an element is in a list.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\nIf the function is implemented correctly, this assertion will pass.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\n    return any(i in list2 for i in list1)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `any` function to check if any element in the first list is in the second list.
