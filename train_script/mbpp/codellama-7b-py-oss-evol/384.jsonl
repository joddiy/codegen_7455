It starts by finding the middle element of the array. If the middle element is the element we're looking for, then it checks if this is the last occurrence of the element in the array. If it is, then it returns the middle index. If it's not, then it continues the search on the right side of the array. If the middle element is greater than the element we're looking for, then it checks if the left pointer is greater than the midpoint. If it is, then the element is not in the left half of the array, so it returns -1. Otherwise, it continues the search on the left side of the array. If the middle element is less than the element we're looking for, then it checks if the right pointer is less than the midpoint. If it is, then the element is not in the right half of the array, so it returns -1. Otherwise, it continues the search on the right side of the array.
