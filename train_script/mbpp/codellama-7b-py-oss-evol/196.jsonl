Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2):\n        sum += i**3\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the first 2n even natural numbers (starting from 2 and ending at 2n).
