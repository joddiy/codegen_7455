Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract values between quotation marks from a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_values('\"Python\", \"PHP\", \"Java\"')==['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(s):\n    return [i.strip('\"') for i in s.split(',')]\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string `s` by commas, and then stripping the quotation marks from each resulting string.
