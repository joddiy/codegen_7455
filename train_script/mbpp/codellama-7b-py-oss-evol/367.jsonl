{"task_id": "Mbpp/772", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that removes all the words with length k from the given string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    result = ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into a list of words, then using a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes words of length not equal to k. Finally, it joins the new list of words back into a string with a space in between each word and returns the result.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\nThis will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes all the words with length k from the given string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    result = ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into a list of words, then using a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes words of length not equal to k.
