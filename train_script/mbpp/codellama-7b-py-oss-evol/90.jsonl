It then subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value to find the maximum difference.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if the function is working correctly, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    return max(arr) - min(arr)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
