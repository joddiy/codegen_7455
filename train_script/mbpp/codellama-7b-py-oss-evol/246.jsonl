The `%` operator is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of the division of `i` by 2. If `i` is odd, the remainder of the division by 2 is 1, so `i % 2 != 0` is True.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Split(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the list and only include the elements that are odd (i.e., where `i % 2 != 0`).
