Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that uses the Pancake Sort algorithm to sort a list of elements.\n\n```python\ndef pancake_sort(lst):\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Find the maximum number in the unsorted sublist\n        max_idx = i\n        for j in range(i):\n            if lst[j] > lst[max_idx]:\n                max_idx = j\n\n        # If the maximum number is not the first element, we need to flip it to the first position\n        if max_idx != i - 1:\n            # Flip the sublist to put the maximum number at the end\n            lst = lst[:max_idx+1][::-1] + lst[max_idx+1:]\n            # Flip the whole list to put the maximum number at the beginning\n            lst = lst[:i][::-1] + lst[i:]\n\n    return lst\n\n# Test the function\nassert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over the list in reverse order, finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list, and then flipping the list to put the maximum element at the start.
