{"task_id": "Mbpp/764", "completion": "\n Here is a simple Python function that counts the number of digits in a given string:\n\n```python\ndef number_ctr(s):\n    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string `s` and checking if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method. If it is a digit, it returns `True`, which gets counted by the `sum()` function. If it is not a digit, it returns `False`, which gets ignored.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, because there is one digit in the string 'program2bedone' (the '2').", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count number of digits in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that counts the number of digits in a given string:\n\n```python\ndef number_ctr(s):\n    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string `s` and checking if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method.
