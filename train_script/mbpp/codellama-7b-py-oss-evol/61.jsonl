Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge_sorted_list([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110],[19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154],[24, 26, 54, 48])==[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):\n    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)\n\nassert merge_sorted_list([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110],[19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154],[24, 26, 54, 48])==[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `merge_sorted_list` that takes three lists as input and returns a new list that is the result of merging the three input lists and sorting the result. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the provided assertion."}
