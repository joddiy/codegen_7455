If it is, the function returns `None` as per the problem statement. If the radius is not negative, the function calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with the given radius. The area is calculated using the formula `0.5 * sqrt(3) * (radius ^ 2)`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert triangle_area(-1) == None\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(radius):\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return 0.5 * math.sqrt(3) * (radius ** 2)\n\nassert triangle_area(-1) == None\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the given radius is negative.
