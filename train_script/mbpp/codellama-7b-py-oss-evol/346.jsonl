Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert capital_words_spaces(\"Python\") == 'Python'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s):\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    for i in range(len(words)):\n        if words[i][0].isupper():\n            words[i] = ' ' + words[i]\n    return ''.join(words)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words, then checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter.
