The `for` loop inside the `tuple` function uses list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating a list and then converting it into a tuple.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)\n```\n\nThis will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef substract_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(x - y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously, and the `tuple` function to convert the result into a tuple.
