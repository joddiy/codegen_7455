The function `max_sum_increasing_subseq` takes an array `arr`, two indices `i` and `j` and a third index `k`. It first checks if `i` is greater than `j`, in which case it returns 0. If `i` is equal to `j`, it returns the value at `i` in the array.\n\nThen it initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `j + 1` with all elements as 0. It then iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `j + 1`, and for each index `x`, it calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at index `x`. The maximum sum is either the maximum sum ending at `x - 1` or the maximum sum ending at `x - 2` plus the value at `x`.\n\nFinally, it returns the value at index `k` in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at index `k`.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function returns the correct result for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, i, k, j):\n    if i > j:\n        return 0\n    if i == j:\n        return arr[i]\n    dp = [0] * (j + 1)\n    dp[i] = arr[i]\n    for x in range(i + 1, j + 1):\n        dp[x] = max(dp[x - 1], dp[x - 2] + arr[x])\n    return dp[k]\n\nassert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11\n```\n\nThis script uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
