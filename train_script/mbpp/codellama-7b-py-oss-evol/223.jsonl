Then it filters this list to only include the even factors. Finally, it sums up the even factors and returns the result.\n\nThe assertion you provided is satisfied by this function, so you can test it with:\n\n```python\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n):\n    factors = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0]\n    even_factors = [i for i in factors if i % 2 == 0]\n    return sum(even_factors)\n```\n\nThis function works by first generating a list of all factors of the input number.
