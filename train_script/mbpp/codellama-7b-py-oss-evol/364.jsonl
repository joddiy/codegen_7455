Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    return [i for i in list1 if i not in list2]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements from `list1` that are not in `list2`.
