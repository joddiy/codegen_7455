Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the median of three numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that calculates the median of three numbers:\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a, b, c):\n    return sorted([a, b, c])[1]\n\nassert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a list with the three numbers, then sorting that list and returning the second element (index 1, since Python uses zero-based indexing).
