The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of its side length.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if the function is correct, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube:\n\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    return 6 * side_length ** 2\n```\n\nThis function takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the lateral surface area.
