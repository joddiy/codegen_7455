Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef union_elements(t1, t2):\n    return sorted(set(t1 + t2))\n\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nIn this function, we first concatenate the two tuples using the + operator.
