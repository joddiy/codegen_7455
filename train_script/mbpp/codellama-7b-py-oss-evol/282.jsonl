Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_Swaps(bin1, bin2):\n    swaps = 0\n    bin1 = list(bin1)\n    bin2 = list(bin2)\n    while bin1:\n        i = bin1.index('1')\n        temp = bin1[i]\n        bin1[i] = '0'\n        j = bin2.index('1')\n        bin2[j] = '0'\n        swaps += 1\n    return swaps - 1\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the binary numbers and swapping the '1's in the first binary number with '0's in the second binary number.
