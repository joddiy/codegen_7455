Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the maximum of two numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximum(5,10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef maximum(a, b):\n    return max(a, b)\n\nassert maximum(5,10) == 10\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in Python function `max()` to find the maximum of two numbers.
