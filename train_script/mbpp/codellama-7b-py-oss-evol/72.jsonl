Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to get the angle of a complex number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(angle_complex(0,1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that defines a function `angle_complex` to calculate the angle of a complex number.
