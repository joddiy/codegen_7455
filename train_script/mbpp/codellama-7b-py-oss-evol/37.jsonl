Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_Char(s):\n    sum_ascii = sum(ord(c) for c in s)\n    return chr((sum_ascii % 26) + ord('a'))\n\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\nIn this function, we first calculate the sum of ASCII values of all characters in the string.
