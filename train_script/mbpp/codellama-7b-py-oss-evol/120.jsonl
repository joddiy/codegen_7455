It initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i...j]`. It then fills in the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner. If the substring `s[i...j]` is a palindrome, it sets `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`. If the substring is not a palindrome, it sets `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i][j-1]` and `dp[i+1][j]`.
