It does this by multiplying each number from 1 to n (inclusive) together. The modulo operator (%) is used to get the last digit of the factorial.\n\nThe function is then tested with the assertion:\n\n```python\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the last digit in the factorial of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        return factorial % 10\n```\n\nThis function works by calculating the factorial of the given number.
