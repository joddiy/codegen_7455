Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuples):\n    # Sort the tuples by the first element of each tuple\n    tuples.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum difference to be the difference between the first and second elements of the first tuple\n    max_diff = tuples[1][0] - tuples[0][0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted tuples\n    for i in range(1, len(tuples)):\n        # Update the maximum difference if the difference between the current tuple and the previous one is larger\n        max_diff = max(max_diff, tuples[i][0] - tuples[i-1][1])\n    \n    return max_diff\n\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\nThis script works by first sorting the input list of tuples by the first element of each tuple.
