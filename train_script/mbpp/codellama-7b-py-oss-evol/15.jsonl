Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check(n):\n    reverse = int(str(n)[::-1])\n    return n == reverse - 2\n```\n\nThis function works by first reversing the number, then subtracting 2 from the reversed number.
