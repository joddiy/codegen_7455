Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    return sum(set(lst))\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, and then calculating the sum of the remaining elements.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\nThis should pass, as the sum of the non-repeated elements in the list [1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6] is indeed 21."}
