Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count([True,False,True]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count(lst):\n    return sum(lst)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the built-in `sum` function, which adds up all the elements in the list.
