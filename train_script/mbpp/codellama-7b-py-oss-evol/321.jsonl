Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to reverse an array upto a given position. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    return arr[:k][::-1] + arr[k:]\n```\n\nThis function takes an array and a position `k` as input.
