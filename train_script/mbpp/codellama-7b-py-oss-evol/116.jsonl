Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef replace_list(list1, list2):\n    list1[-1:] = list2\n    return list1\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's slicing feature to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
