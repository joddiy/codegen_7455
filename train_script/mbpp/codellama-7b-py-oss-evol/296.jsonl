The built-in `max()` function then finds the maximum value among these elements.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if the function is correct, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\n    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to iterate over each row in the matrix and select the nth element.
