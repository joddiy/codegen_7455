Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that calculates the area of a tetrahedron:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef area_tetrahedron(edge_length):\n    return (edge_length ** 2) * math.sqrt(2) / 12\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the area of a tetrahedron, which is `(edge_length ** 2) * sqrt(2) / 12`.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nassert abs(area_tetrahedron(3) - 15.588457268119894) < 1e-9\nprint(\"All tests pass\")\n```\n\nThis code asserts that the calculated area is close to the expected value (within a small tolerance), and prints \"All tests pass\" if all tests pass.
