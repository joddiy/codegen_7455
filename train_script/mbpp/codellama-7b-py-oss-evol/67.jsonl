Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert all possible convertible elements in a list of lists to floats. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert list_to_float( [(\"3\", \"4\"), (\"1\", \"26.45\"), (\"7.32\", \"8\"), (\"4\", \"8\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef list_to_float(lst):\n    return [(float(x), float(y)) for x, y in lst]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list.
