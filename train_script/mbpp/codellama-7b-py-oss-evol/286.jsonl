Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find sum and average of first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_average(n):\n    sum_num = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    avg_num = n / 2.0\n    return (sum_num, avg_num)\n\nassert sum_average(10) == (55, 5.5)\n```\n\nIn this function, we first calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.
