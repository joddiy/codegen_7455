Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_words(\"python program\")==(\"program python\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s):\n    return ' '.join(s.split()[::-1])\n\nassert reverse_words(\"python program\")==(\"program python\")\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method, which splits the string at each space character.
