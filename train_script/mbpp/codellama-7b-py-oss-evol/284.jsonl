Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n    len1 = len(arr1)\n    len2 = len(arr2)\n    if len1 == 0:\n        return arr2[k - 1]\n    if len2 == 0:\n        return arr1[k - 1]\n    if k == 1:\n        return min(arr1[0], arr2[0])\n\n    if arr1[0] < arr2[0]:\n        if k <= len1:\n            return find_kth(arr1[1:], arr2, k)\n        else:\n            return find_kth(arr1, arr2[1:], k - len1 - 1)\n    else:\n        if k <= len1 + len2:\n            return find_kth(arr1, arr2[1:], k)\n        else:\n            return find_kth(arr1[1:], arr2, k - len1 - 1)\n```\n\nThis function uses a recursive approach to find the kth element.
