{"task_id": "Mbpp/730", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that removes consecutive duplicates from a list:\n\n```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    result = [lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i == 0 or lst[i] != lst[i-1]]\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the list and checking each element against the previous one. If they are not the same, it adds the element to the result list. This effectively removes consecutive duplicates from the list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes consecutive duplicates from a list:\n\n```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    result = [lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i == 0 or lst[i] != lst[i-1]]\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the list and checking each element against the previous one.
