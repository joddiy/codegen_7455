Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr, num):\n    for i in arr:\n        if i > num:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each element in the array and checks if it is greater than the given number.
