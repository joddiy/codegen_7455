The `enumerate` function is used to get the index of each character. The condition `(i+1)%2 == 0` checks if the index is even. If it is, the character is included in the new string. The `join` function is used to concatenate the characters into a single string.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove odd characters in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_odd(\"python\")==(\"yhn\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes odd characters from a string:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s):\n    return ''.join([ch for i, ch in enumerate(s) if (i+1)%2 == 0])\n\nassert remove_odd(\"python\") == \"yhn\"\n```\n\nIn this function, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the string.
