If it finds a character that appears more than once in the string (checked using the `count` method), it returns that character.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s):\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s.count(s[i]) > 1:\n            return s[i]\n    return None\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each character in the string.
