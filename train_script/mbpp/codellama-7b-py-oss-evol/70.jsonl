Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==36\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(lst):\n    # Flatten the list of tuples\n    flat_list = [item for sublist in lst for item in sublist]\n    \n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    sorted_list = sorted(flat_list)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum absolute product\n    max_product = max(sorted_list[-1] * sorted_list[-2], sorted_list[0] * sorted_list[1])\n    \n    return max_product\n\n# Test the function\nassert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]) == 36\n```\n\nThis script works by first flattening the list of tuples into a single list.
