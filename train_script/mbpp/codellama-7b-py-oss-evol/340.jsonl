If all the characters are the same, the set will only contain one character. If not, the set will contain more than one character. The function then checks if the length of the set is 1.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass, because \"python\" contains different characters.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that checks if all the characters in a string are the same:\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s):\n    return len(set(s)) == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the string into a set, which automatically removes duplicate characters.
