Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to replace characters in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_char(\"polygon\",'y','l')==(\"pollgon\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that replaces characters in a string:\n\n```python\ndef replace_char(s, old_char, new_char):\n    return s.replace(old_char, new_char)\n```\n\nYou can use this function to replace characters in a string.
