{"task_id": "Mbpp/238", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s):\n    return len(s) * (len(s) + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n*(n+1)/2`, where `n` is the number of terms. In this case, the number of terms is the length of the string, and the length of each substring is also the length of the string, so the function returns `len(s) * (len(s) + 1) // 2`.\n\nThis function works for all strings, not just non-empty ones. If you want to count only non-empty substrings, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s):\n    return len(s) * (len(s) - 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function works by subtracting 1 from the length of the string, and then using the same formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of non-empty substrings of a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_of_substrings(\"abc\") == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s):\n    return len(s) * (len(s) + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n*(n+1)/2`, where `n` is the number of terms.
