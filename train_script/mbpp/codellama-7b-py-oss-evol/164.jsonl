Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\n    # Initialize count to 0\n    count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over all possible sums of first n bits\n    for i in range(2**n):\n        # Convert the sum to binary and count the number of 1's\n        count += bin(i).count('1')\n\n    # Return the count\n    return count\n\n# Test the function\nassert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over all possible sums of the first n bits, converting each sum to binary, and counting the number of 1's in the binary representation.
