If the number is 2 or 3, it is prime. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If it is, it is not prime. If none of these conditions are met, it checks for divisibility by all numbers of the form 6k \u00b1 1, starting from 5 and stepping by 6 each time. If it finds a number that divides evenly into the input number, it is not prime. If it does not find such a number, it is prime.\n\nThe function satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert is_not_prime(2) == False\n```\n\nThis assertion passes, because 2 is a prime number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
