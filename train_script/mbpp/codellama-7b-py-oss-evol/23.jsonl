Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to flatten a list and sum all of its elements. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_list_sum(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for i in lst:\n        if isinstance(i, list):\n            total += recursive_list_sum(i)\n        else:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\nassert recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]])==21\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the list.
