It initializes a counter `count` to 0. Then, it iterates over each element `i` in the tuple. If the element is not a tuple, it increments `count` by 1. If the element is a tuple, it increments `count` by the number of elements in the tuple.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) ) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_first_elements(t):\n    count = 0\n    for i in t:\n        if not isinstance(i, tuple):\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            count += len(i)\n    return count\n\nassert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) ) == 3\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `count_first_elements` that takes a tuple `t` as input.
