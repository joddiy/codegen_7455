{"task_id": "Mbpp/630", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_coordinates(coord):\n    x, y = coord\n    return [[a, b] for a in range(x-1, x+2) for b in range(y-1, y+2) if (a, b) != coord]\n```\n\nThis function takes a coordinate tuple as input, and then generates all the possible adjacent coordinates. It does this by iterating over all possible x and y values within one step of the given coordinate. The function then checks if the generated coordinate is not equal to the input coordinate, and if it is not, it is added to the list of coordinates.\n\nThe function is tested with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]\n```\n\nIf the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_coordinates(coord):\n    x, y = coord\n    return [[a, b] for a in range(x-1, x+2) for b in range(y-1, y+2) if (a, b) != coord]\n```\n\nThis function takes a coordinate tuple as input, and then generates all the possible adjacent coordinates.
