Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to reverse only the vowels of a given string (where y is not a vowel). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that reverses only the vowels of a given string:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n    while i < j:\n        if s_list[i] not in vowels:\n            i += 1\n        elif s_list[j] not in vowels:\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]\n            i, j = i + 1, j - 1\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating from both ends of the string towards the center.
