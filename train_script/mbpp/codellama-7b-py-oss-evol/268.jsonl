{"task_id": "Mbpp/580", "completion": "\n Here is a Python function that removes the uneven elements from the nested tuple:\n\n```python\ndef extract_even(nested_tuple):\n    result = []\n    for item in nested_tuple:\n        if isinstance(item, tuple):\n            result.append(extract_even(item))\n        elif item % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(item)\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each item in the input tuple. If the item is a tuple itself, it recursively calls `extract_even` on that item. If the item is an even number, it is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns a tuple of the items in the result list.\n\nThis function satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\nassert extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that removes the uneven elements from the nested tuple:\n\n```python\ndef extract_even(nested_tuple):\n    result = []\n    for item in nested_tuple:\n        if isinstance(item, tuple):\n            result.append(extract_even(item))\n        elif item % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(item)\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each item in the input tuple.
