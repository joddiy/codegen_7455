Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(lst):\n    # Flatten the list of tuples\n    flat_list = [item for sublist in lst for item in sublist]\n    \n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    sorted_list = sorted(flat_list)\n    \n    # Return the product of the smallest two numbers\n    return sorted_list[0] * sorted_list[1]\n\n# Test the function\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]) == 8\n```\n\nThis function works by first flattening the list of tuples into a single list, then sorting that list in ascending order.
