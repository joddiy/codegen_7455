Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find whether all the given tuples have equal length or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    length = len(tuples[0])\n    for t in tuples:\n        if len(t) != length:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function works by first determining the expected length of the tuples (which is the length of the first tuple in the list).
