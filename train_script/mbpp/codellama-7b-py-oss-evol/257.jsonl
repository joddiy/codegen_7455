Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_digits(345)==12\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the integer to a string, then iterating over each character in the string (which are the digits of the number).
