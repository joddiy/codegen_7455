Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 1 << (n - 1).bit_length()\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input is less than or equal to 0.
