Then it uses the `symmetric_difference` method to find the elements that are in one set or the other, but not both. Finally, it converts the resulting set back to a tuple.\n\nThe function can be tested with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if the function works as expected, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(t1, t2):\n    t1_set = set(t1)\n    t2_set = set(t2)\n    return tuple(t1_set.symmetric_difference(t2_set))\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the tuples to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements.
