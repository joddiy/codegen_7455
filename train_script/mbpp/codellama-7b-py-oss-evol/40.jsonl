Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find nth centered hexagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n    return n*(2*n - 1)\n\nassert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271\n```\n\nThe function `centered_hexagonal_number(n)` calculates the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula `n*(2*n - 1)`.
