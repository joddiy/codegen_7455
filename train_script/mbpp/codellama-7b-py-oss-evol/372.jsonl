Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef find_combinations(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, len(lst) + 1):\n        for subset in combinations(lst, i):\n            if sum(x[0] for x in subset) == sum(x[1] for x in subset):\n                result.append(tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(*subset)))\n    return result\n\nassert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]\n```\n\nThis script uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of the given tuples.
