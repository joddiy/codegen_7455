If either condition is true, the function returns True, indicating that the numbers have opposite signs. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\nThis will pass if the function is implemented correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that checks if two integers have opposite signs:\n\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a, b):\n    return (a < 0 and b > 0) or (a > 0 and b < 0)\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if one number is positive and the other is negative, or vice versa.
