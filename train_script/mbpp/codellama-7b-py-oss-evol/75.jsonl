Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to multiply two integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiply_int(10,20)==200\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a simple Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_int(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\nassert multiply_int(10,20)==200\n```\n\nIn this function, `a` and `b` are the two integers to be multiplied.
