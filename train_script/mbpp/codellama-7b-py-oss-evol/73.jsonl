Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_length(\"11000010001\") == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string):\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_diff = 0\n    zero_count = 0\n    one_count = 0\n\n    for char in binary_string:\n        if char == '0':\n            zero_count += 1\n        else:\n            one_count += 1\n        current_diff = abs(zero_count - one_count)\n        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)\n\n    return max_diff\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each character in the binary string.
