Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count the total number of characters in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_charac(\"python programming\")==18\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that satisfies the given assertion:\n\n```python\ndef count_charac(string):\n    return len(string)\n```\n\nYou can use this function to count the total number of characters in a string by calling it with the string as an argument.
