Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Odd_Pair([5,4,7,2,1],5) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if (arr[i]^arr[j])%2 != 0:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all pairs of elements in the array, and for each pair, it checks if the XOR of the pair's elements is odd.
