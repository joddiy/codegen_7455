Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))==[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\n    return [sum(t)/len(t) for t in tuples]\n```\n\nThis function works by using a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the input list, calculating the average value for each tuple by summing the values and dividing by the number of values, and then returning the resulting list of averages.\n\nThe assertion checks that this function returns the correct result for the given input."}
