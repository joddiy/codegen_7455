Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lst):\n    return min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses a generator expression to find the lengths of all sublists in the input list, and then uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest length.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided assertion:\n\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if the function is working correctly."}
