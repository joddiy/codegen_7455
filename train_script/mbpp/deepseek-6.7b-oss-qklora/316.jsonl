Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def wind_chill(wind_velocity, temperature):\n        wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * (wind_velocity ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temperature * (wind_velocity ** 0.16)\n        return round(wind_chill_index)\n    ```"}
