It first creates a set of unique numbers in the list using the `set` function. Then, it iterates through the set of unique numbers and multiplies them together to calculate the product. Finally, it returns the product.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]) ==  720000000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef unique_product(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\n    ### Test:\n```python\nassert unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]) ==  720000000\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `unique_product` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the product of the unique numbers in the list.
