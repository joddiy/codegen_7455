Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to get the frequency of all the elements in a list, returned as a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def freq_count(lst):\n        freq = {}\n        for item in lst:\n            if item in freq:\n                freq[item] += 1\n            else:\n                freq[item] = 1\n        return freq\n    ```\n\n    The `freq_count` function takes a list `lst` as input and returns a dictionary `freq` that contains the frequency of each element in the list.
