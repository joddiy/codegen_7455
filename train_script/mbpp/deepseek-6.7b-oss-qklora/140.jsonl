Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and finds the sum of the first n even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def even_Power_Sum(n):\n        sum = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            sum += (2*i)**5\n        return sum\n    ```\n\n    The `even_Power_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers raised to the fifth power.
