Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_char_long(string):\n        words = string.split()\n        char_long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]\n        return char_long_words\n    ```\n\n    The `find_char_long` function takes a string as input and splits it into words.
