Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_Parity(num):\n        return num % 2 == 1\n    ```\n\n    The `find_Parity` function takes a number as input and returns `True` if the parity of the number is odd, and `False` otherwise.
