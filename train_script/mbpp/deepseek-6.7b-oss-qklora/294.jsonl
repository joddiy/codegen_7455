Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find nth bell number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert bell_Number(2) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def bell_Number(n):\n        bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]\n        bell[0][0] = 1\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n            for j in range(1, i+1):\n                bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n        return bell[n][0]\n    ```\n    The `bell_Number` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Bell number.
