Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_sum(lst):\n        unique_elements = set()\n        sum_of_unique = 0\n        for num in lst:\n            if num not in unique_elements:\n                unique_elements.add(num)\n                sum_of_unique += num\n        return sum_of_unique\n    ```\n    The `find_sum` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all unique elements in the list.
