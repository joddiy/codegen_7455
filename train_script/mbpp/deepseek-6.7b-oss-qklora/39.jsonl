Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the surface area of a sphere. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(surfacearea_sphere(10), 1256.6370614359173, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    def surfacearea_sphere(radius):\n        return 4 * math.pi * radius ** 2\n\n    assert math.isclose(surfacearea_sphere(10), 1256.6370614359173, rel_tol=0.001)\n    ```\n\n    The `surfacearea_sphere` function takes a radius as input and returns the surface area of a sphere with that radius.
