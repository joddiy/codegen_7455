It iterates through the list, finding the maximum element and flipping it to the front, then flipping the entire list to the front. This process is repeated until the list is sorted in ascending order.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort a list of elements. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef pancake_sort(lst):\n    for i in range(len(lst), 1, -1):\n        max_index = lst.index(max(lst[:i]))\n        if max_index != i - 1:\n            lst = lst[:max_index+1][::-1] + lst[max_index+1:]\n            lst = lst[:i][::-1] + lst[i:]\n    return lst\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The pancake_sort function takes a list of elements as input and sorts it in ascending order using the pancake sorting algorithm.
