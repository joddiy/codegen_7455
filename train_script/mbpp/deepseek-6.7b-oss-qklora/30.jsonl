Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def dif_Square(n):\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for j in range(1, n):\n                if i*i + j*j == n:\n                    return True\n        return False\n    ```\n    The function `dif_Square` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares, and `False` otherwise.
