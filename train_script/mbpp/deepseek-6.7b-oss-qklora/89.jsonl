Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find number of lists present in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_lists(tuple_of_lists):\n        count = 0\n        for item in tuple_of_lists:\n            if isinstance(item, list):\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n\n    The `find_lists` function takes a tuple of lists as input and returns the number of lists present in the tuple.
