The mask `0b10101010101010101010101010101010` is used to set the even bits of the input number.\n    The resulting number is returned as the output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(num):\n    return num | 0b10101010101010101010101010101010\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `even_bit_set_number` takes a number `num` as input and returns a new number with all even bits set.\n    The `|` operator is used to set the even bits of the input number.
