Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def is_woodall(n):\n        # Convert the number to a string and split it into digits\n        digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]\n        \n        # Check if the number is divisible by the sum of its digits\n        return n % sum(digits) == 0\n    ```\n    The `is_woodall` function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if the number is woodball, and `False` otherwise.
