Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n        merged_arr = sorted(arr1 + arr2)\n        return merged_arr[k - 1]\n    ```\n\n    The `find_kth` function takes two sorted arrays `arr1` and `arr2` and an integer `k` as input.
