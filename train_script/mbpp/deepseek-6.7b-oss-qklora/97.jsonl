Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def next_power_of_2(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()\n    ```\n    The `bit_length` method returns the number of bits required to represent the number in binary.
