Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def kth_element(arr, k):\n        arr.sort()\n        return arr[k-1]\n    ```\n    The `kth_element` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It sorts the array in ascending order and then returns the element at index `k-1`, which is the kth smallest element in the array."}
