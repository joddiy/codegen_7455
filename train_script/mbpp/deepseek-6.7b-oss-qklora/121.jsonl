It does this by converting the arrays to sets and using the `&` operator to find the intersection. The result is then converted back to a list and returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])==[1, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef intersection_array(arr1, arr2):\n    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `intersection_array` function takes two arrays as input and returns the intersection of the two arrays.
