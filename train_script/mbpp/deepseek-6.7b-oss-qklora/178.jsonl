It does this by creating a set from the tuple and checking if the length of the tuple is equal to the length of the set. If they are equal, all elements are distinct, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if given tuple contains no duplicates. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def check_distinct(tup):\n        return len(tup) == len(set(tup))\n    ```\n\n    The `check_distinct` function takes a tuple as input and returns `True` if all elements are distinct, and `False` otherwise.
