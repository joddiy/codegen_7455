{"task_id": "Mbpp/471", "completion": "\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for i in arr:\n        product = (product * i) % n\n    return product\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `find_remainder` takes two arguments: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer. It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and then iterates through the elements of `arr`, multiplying them together and taking the modulo of the result with `n`. Finally, it returns the value of `product`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the product of the array multiplication modulo n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for i in arr:\n        product = (product * i) % n\n    return product\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `find_remainder` takes two arguments: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer.
