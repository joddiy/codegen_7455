If the result is negative, then the signs are opposite.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a, b):\n    return (a ^ b) < 0\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The XOR operator (^) returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. If the result is negative, then the signs are opposite."}
