It returns the concatenation of `lst` and the list representation of `tpl`. This concatenation satisfies the assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def add_tuple(lst, tpl):\n        return lst + list(tpl)\n    ```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `add_tuple` function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input.
