It returns `True` if all elements have the same data type, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def check_type(tuple):\n        return all(isinstance(x, type(tuple[0])) for x in tuple)\n    ```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `check_type` function takes a tuple as input and uses a generator expression to check if all elements in the tuple have the same data type.
