It then checks if the buy and sell prices are equal, and returns `True` if they are, indicating that there is no profit or loss. If the buy and sell prices are not equal, the function returns `False`, indicating that there is a profit or loss.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(buy_price, sell_price):\n    if buy_price == sell_price:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `noprofit_noloss` takes two arguments, `buy_price` and `sell_price`, which represent the buy and sell prices of an asset.
