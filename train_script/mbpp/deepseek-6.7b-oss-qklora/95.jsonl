Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def count_char_position(string):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(string)):\n            if string[i].lower() == chr(97 + i):\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n\n    The `count_char_position` function takes a string as input and iterates through each character, checking if it is the same as the character at the same position in the English alphabet (case insensitive).
