Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==36\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n    max_product = 0\n    for i in range(len(list_of_tuples)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(list_of_tuples)):\n            product = abs(list_of_tuples[i][0] * list_of_tuples[j][0]) * abs(list_of_tuples[i][1] * list_of_tuples[j][1])\n            if product > max_product:\n                max_product = product\n    return max_product\n\nassert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==36\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through all pairs of tuples in the given list and calculates the absolute product between the numbers in each pair.
