Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n        dissimilar = []\n        for i in tuple1:\n            if i not in tuple2:\n                dissimilar.append(i)\n        for i in tuple2:\n            if i not in tuple1:\n                dissimilar.append(i)\n        return tuple(dissimilar)\n    ```\n\n    The `find_dissimilar` function takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the dissimilar elements between the two tuples.
