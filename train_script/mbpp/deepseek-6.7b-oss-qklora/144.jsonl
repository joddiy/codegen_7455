Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    def volume_cylinder(radius, height):\n        return math.pi * radius**2 * height\n\n    assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n    ```\n\n    The `volume_cylinder` function takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume of the cylinder.
