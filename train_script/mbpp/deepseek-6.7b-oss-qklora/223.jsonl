Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def sumofFactors(n):\n        sum = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            if n % i == 0 and i % 2 == 0:\n                sum += i\n        return sum\n    ```\n\n    The `sumofFactors` function takes a number `n` as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
