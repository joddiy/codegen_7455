Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)] , [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def tuple_intersection(tuple_list1, tuple_list2):\n        intersection = set()\n        for tup1 in tuple_list1:\n            for tup2 in tuple_list2:\n                if tup1 == tup2 or tup1 == tup2[::-1]:\n                    intersection.add(tup1)\n        return intersection\n    ```"}
