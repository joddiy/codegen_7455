Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    ludic = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if is_ludic(i):\n            ludic.append(i)\n    return ludic\n\ndef is_ludic(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return is_ludic(n // 2)\n```\n\n    The `get_ludic` function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is lucid using the `is_ludic` function.
