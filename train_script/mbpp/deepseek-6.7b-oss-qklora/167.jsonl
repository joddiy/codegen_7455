Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i . Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n        # Initialize the maximum sum to 0\n        max_sum = 0\n\n        # Iterate through the array from index i to k\n        for j in range(i, k+1):\n            # Check if the current element is greater than the previous element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j-1]:\n                # Update the maximum sum if the current sum is greater\n                max_sum = max(max_sum, arr[j])\n\n        return max_sum\n    ```\n\n    This function takes an array `arr`, its length `n`, an index `i`, and an index `k` as input. It iterates through the array from index `i` to `k` and finds the maximum sum of increasing subsequence. If the current element is greater than the previous element, it updates the maximum sum. Finally, it returns the maximum sum."}
