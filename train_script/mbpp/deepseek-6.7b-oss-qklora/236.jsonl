The function uses a generator expression to create the new tuple, which is then returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef add_pairwise(tup):\n    return tuple(tup[i] + tup[i+1] for i in range(len(tup)-1))\n```\n\n    ### Test:\n```python\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `add_pairwise` takes a tuple `tup` as input and returns a tuple containing the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of `tup`.
