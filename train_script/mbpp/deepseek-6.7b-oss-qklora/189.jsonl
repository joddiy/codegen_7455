It then iterates through the list, comparing each element to the current minimum value and updating it if a smaller value is found. Finally, it returns the minimum value found.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_val(lst):\n    min_val = lst[0]\n    for i in lst:\n        if i < min_val:\n            min_val = i\n    return min_val\n\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `min_val` takes a list as input and initializes the minimum value to the first element of the list.
