Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_combinations(tuples):\n        combinations = []\n        for i in range(len(tuples)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(tuples)):\n                combinations.append((tuples[i][0] + tuples[j][0], tuples[i][1] + tuples[j][1]))\n        return combinations\n    ```\n\n    The `find_combinations` function takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of tuples representing the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list.
