Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def re_arrange_array(arr, n):\n        j = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if arr[i] < 0:\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n                j += 1\n        return arr\n    ```\n    The `re_arrange_array` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` as input. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the array and moves all negative elements to the beginning of the array. The function then returns the re-arranged array."}
