Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of lists in a given number of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def count_list(lst):\n        count = 0\n        for item in lst:\n            if isinstance(item, list):\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n\n    The `count_list` function takes a list as input and returns the number of lists in the input list.
