Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert median_trapezium(15,25,35)==20\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a, b, c):\n    return (a + b - c) / 2\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The median length of a trapezium is calculated as the average of the two parallel sides.
