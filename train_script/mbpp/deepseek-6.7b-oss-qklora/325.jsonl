Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    The input is defined as two lists of the same length. Write a function to count indices where the lists have the same values. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(list1)):\n            if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n    The `count_same_pair` function takes two lists as input and returns the number of indices where the lists have the same values.
