It then iterates through each element in the list and checks if it is an integer using the `isinstance` function. If it is an integer, the `count` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def count_integer(lst):\n        count = 0\n        for i in lst:\n            if isinstance(i, int):\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n\n    The `count_integer` function takes a list `lst` as input and initializes a variable `count` to 0.
