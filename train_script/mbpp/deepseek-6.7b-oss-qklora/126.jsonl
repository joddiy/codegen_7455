Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in a list and length n, and generates all combinations (with repetition) of the elements of the list and returns a list with a tuple for each combination. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert combinations_colors( [\"Red\",\"Green\",\"Blue\"],1)==[('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def combinations_colors(colors, n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return [()]\n        else:\n            result = []\n            for i in range(len(colors)):\n                sub_combinations = combinations_colors(colors, n-1)\n                for combination in sub_combinations:\n                    result.append(combination + (colors[i],))\n            return result\n    ```\n    The `combinations_colors` function takes in a list of colors and a length n, and returns a list with a tuple for each combination of length n.
