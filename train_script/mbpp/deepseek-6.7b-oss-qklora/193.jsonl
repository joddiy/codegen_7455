It then checks if the product of the last two elements is greater than the product of the first two elements. If it is, it returns the two elements with the highest product; otherwise, it returns the two elements with the lowest product.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find a pair with highest product from a given array of integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Product([1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4]) == (7,8)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def max_Product(arr):\n        arr.sort()\n        if arr[-1] * arr[-2] > arr[0] * arr[1]:\n            return (arr[-1], arr[-2])\n        else:\n            return (arr[0], arr[1])\n    ```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `max_Product` takes an array `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order.
