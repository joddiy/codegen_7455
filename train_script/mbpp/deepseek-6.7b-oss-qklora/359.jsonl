Then, it iterates through the sorted array and calculates the difference between adjacent elements. It updates the minimum difference if the current difference is smaller than the previous minimum difference. Finally, it returns the minimum difference found.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-difference-pair/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_min_diff(arr, n):\n    arr.sort()\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n    return min_diff\n\nassert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function first sorts the array in ascending order.
