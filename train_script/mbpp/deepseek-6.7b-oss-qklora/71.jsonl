If a number is amicable, it is added to the sum. The function `sum_divisors` calculates the sum of the divisors of a number.\n\n    The assertion checks if the sum of amicable numbers from 1 to 999 is equal to 504.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.
