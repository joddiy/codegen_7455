It iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is a divisor of `n`. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of divisors of a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef divisor(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n    ### Test:\n```python\nassert divisor(15) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of divisors of `n`.
