Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_Rotations(s):\n        # Find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string\n        n = len(s)\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if s[i:] + s[:i] == s:\n                return i\n        return 0\n    ```\n\n    The `find_Rotations` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string.
