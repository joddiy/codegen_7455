It uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n`, and for each iteration, it multiplies the current number by the next number and adds the result to the `sum`. Finally, it returns the `sum`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def sum_Of_product(n):\n        sum = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            sum += i * (i+1)\n        return sum\n    ```\n\n    The `sum_Of_product` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients up to `n`.
