It first sorts the list and then compares it with a list of consecutive numbers to determine if the input list contains consecutive numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst)+1))\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `check_Consecutive` function takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.
