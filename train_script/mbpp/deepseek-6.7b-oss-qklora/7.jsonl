It is removing only the first occurrence of the given character, but not the last occurrence. The assertion is failing because the function is returning \"heo\" instead of \"he\".", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def remove_Occ(string, char):\n        if char in string:\n            string = string.replace(char, '', 1)\n            string = string.replace(char, '', 1)\n        return string\n    ```\n\n    ### Test:\n    ```python\n    assert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n    ```\n\n    ### Output:\n    ```\n    AssertionError\n    ```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `remove_Occ` is not working as expected.
