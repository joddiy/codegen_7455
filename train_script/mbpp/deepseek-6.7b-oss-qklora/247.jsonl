Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert difference(3) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def difference(n):\n        return sum(range(1, n+1))**3 - sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n+1))\n    ```\n\n    The `difference` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
