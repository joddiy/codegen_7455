Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the upper case characters in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert upper_ctr('PYthon') == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def upper_ctr(string):\n        count = 0\n        for char in string:\n            if char.isupper():\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n\n    This function takes a string as input and returns the number of uppercase characters in the string.
