In this case, the closest smaller number is `n - 1`, which is 10 in this example.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the closest smaller number than n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert closest_num(11) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef closest_num(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the closest smaller number than n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n - 1\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function `closest_num` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the closest smaller number than `n`.
