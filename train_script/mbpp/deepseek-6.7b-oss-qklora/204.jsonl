The function uses a generator expression to perform the bitwise AND operation on each pair of elements from the input tuples, and then creates a new tuple from the results. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the elements of the input tuples in parallel, and the `tuple` function is used to create a new tuple from the results.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `and_tuples` function takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple that contains the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.
