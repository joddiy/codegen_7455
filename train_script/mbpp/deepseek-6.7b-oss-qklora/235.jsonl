Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def max_product(arr):\n        max_prod = 0\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n                if arr[j] > arr[i]:\n                    prod = arr[i] * arr[j]\n                    if prod > max_prod:\n                        max_prod = prod\n        return max_prod\n    ```\n    This function iterates through the array and finds the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence.
