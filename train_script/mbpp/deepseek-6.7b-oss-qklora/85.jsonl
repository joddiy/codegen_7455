Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the circumference of a circle. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    def circle_circumference(radius):\n        return 2 * math.pi * radius\n    ```\n\n    The `circle_circumference` function takes the radius of a circle as input and returns its circumference.
