If any element in the second tuple is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, the function returns False. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function returns True.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        if tuple1[i] >= tuple2[i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function iterates through the elements of both tuples and checks if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. If any element in the second tuple is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, the function returns False. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function returns True."}
