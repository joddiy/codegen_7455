For each character, it checks if it is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` method and appends it to the result string. If the character is not uppercase, it is appended as is. Finally, the function returns the resulting string with all uppercase characters converted to lowercase.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove uppercase substrings from a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_uppercase('cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs') == 'cstyoravoitshos'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_uppercase(s):\n    return ''.join(char.lower() if char.isupper() else char for char in s)\n```\n\nThe `remove_uppercase` function takes a string `s` as input and uses a generator expression to iterate through each character in the input string.
