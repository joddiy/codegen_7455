Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]\n    \n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here * num)\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n    \n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nThe `max_product` function iterates through the input array, maintaining the maximum product of numbers encountered so far (`max_so_far`) and the maximum product of numbers in the current increasing subsequence (`max_ending_here`).
