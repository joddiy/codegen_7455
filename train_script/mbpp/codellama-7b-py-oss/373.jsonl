It then iterates through the range from 1 to `n` and increments the count whenever `n` is divisible by the current value of `i`. Finally, it returns `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the count of divisors is even. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/basic/python-basic-1-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_divisors(10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count % 2 == 0\n```\nThe `count_divisors` function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a count variable to 0.
