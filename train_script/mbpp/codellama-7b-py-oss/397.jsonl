Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given tuples contain the k or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef check_K(tup, k):\n    return k in tup\n\n# Test the function\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\nThe `check_K` function takes a tuple `tup` and an integer `k` as input.
