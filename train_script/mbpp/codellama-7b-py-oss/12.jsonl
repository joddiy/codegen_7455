Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\n    for char in str2:\n        str1 = str1.replace(char, '')\n    return str1\n\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\nThe `remove_dirty_chars` function iterates through each character in the second string and removes occurrences of those characters from the first string using the `replace` method.
