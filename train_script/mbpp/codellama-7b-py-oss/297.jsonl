Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef merge(lists):\n    merged_list = []\n    for sublist in lists:\n        merged_list.append(sublist[0])\n        merged_list.append(sublist[1])\n    return [merged_list[::2], merged_list[1::2]]\n```\n\nThe `merge` function takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each sublist to extract the first and second elements.
