Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the common elements in given nested lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])\n    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:\n        common_elements.intersection_update(set(lst))\n    return list(common_elements)\n```\n\nThe `common_in_nested_lists` function takes a list of nested lists as input and iterates through each nested list to find the common elements.
