This solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that matches a word containing 'z'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_wordz(\"pythonz.\")==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef text_match_wordz(text):\n    return 'z' in text\n```\n\nThe provided solution defines a function `text_match_wordz` that takes a string `text` as input.
