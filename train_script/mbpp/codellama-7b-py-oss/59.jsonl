Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count([True,False,True]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count(lst):\n    return sum(1 for x in lst if x is True)\n```\n\nThe `count` function takes a list `lst` as input and uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of `True` booleans in the list.
