Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to divide two lists element wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    return [x / y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]\n\n# Test the function\nassert div_list([4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]) == [4.0, 2.5, 2.0]\n```\n\nThe `div_list` function takes two lists as input and uses a list comprehension to divide the elements of the first list by the corresponding elements of the second list.
