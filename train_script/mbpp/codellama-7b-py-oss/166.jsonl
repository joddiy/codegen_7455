Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert start_withp([\"Python PHP\", \"Java JavaScript\", \"c c++\"])==('Python', 'PHP')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef start_withp(words):\n    for word in words:\n        if word.startswith('p'):\n            words = word.split()\n            return words[0], words[1]\n    return None\n```\n\nThe `start_withp` function iterates through the list of words and checks if each word starts with the letter 'p'.
