Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if not result or result[-1] != i:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `consecutive_duplicates` function iterates through the input list `lst` and appends each element to the `result` list only if it is not equal to the last element in the `result` list.
