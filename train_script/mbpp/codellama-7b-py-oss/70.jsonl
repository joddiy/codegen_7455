Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==36\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_product_tuple(lst):\n    max_product = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            product = lst[i][0] * lst[j][0]\n            if product > max_product:\n                max_product = product\n    return max_product\n```\n\nThe `max_product_tuple` function iterates through all pairs of tuples in the given list and calculates the product of the first elements of each tuple.
