If the string is empty or has only one character, it returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first substring that matches the entire string. If a match is found, it returns the length of the string divided by the length of the matched substring.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_Rotations(s):\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif len(s) == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i:] == s[:i]:\n                return len(s) // len(s[:i])\n        return 0\n```\nThe `find_Rotations` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string.
