Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    perfect_squares_list = []\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        root = num ** 0.5\n        if root == int(root):\n            perfect_squares_list.append(num)\n    return perfect_squares_list\n```\nThe `perfect_squares` function iterates through the range from `start` to `end`, calculates the square root of each number, and appends the number to the `perfect_squares_list` if the square root is an integer.
