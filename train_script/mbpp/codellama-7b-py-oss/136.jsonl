It iterates through the odd numbers from 1 to `n*2` (inclusive) and adds the square of each odd number to the `sum_of_squares`. Finally, it returns the calculated sum of squares. This solution satisfies the given assertion as demonstrated in the problem description.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum of squares\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the first n odd natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n*2, 2):\n        # Add the square of the current odd number to the sum\n        sum_of_squares += i**2\n    \n    return sum_of_squares\n```\n\nThe provided solution defines a function `square_Sum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers.
