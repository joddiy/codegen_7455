Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_rotate(16,2) == 64\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef left_rotate(num, d):\n    return (num << d) | (num >> (32 - d))\n\n# Test the function\nassert left_rotate(16, 2) == 64\n```\n\nThe `left_rotate` function takes a number `num` and a shift amount `d` as input.
