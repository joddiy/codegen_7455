Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count_X(tup, x):\n    count = 0\n    for i in tup:\n        if i == x:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_X` function iterates through the tuple `tup` and increments the `count` variable whenever it encounters the element `x`.
