Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef check_smaller(tup1, tup2):\n    if len(tup1) != len(tup2):\n        return False  # If the tuples are not of equal length, return False\n    for i in range(len(tup1)):\n        if tup1[i] > tup2[i]:\n            return False  # If any element of tup1 is greater than its corresponding element in tup2, return False\n    return True  # If all elements are smaller, return True\n```\n\nThe `check_smaller` function first checks if the lengths of the input tuples are equal.
