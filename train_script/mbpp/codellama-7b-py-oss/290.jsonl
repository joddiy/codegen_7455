Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_words(\"python program\")==(\"program python\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef reverse_words(s):\n    return ' '.join(s.split()[::-1])\n```\n\nThe `reverse_words` function takes a string `s` as input and uses the `split` method to separate the words by spaces.
