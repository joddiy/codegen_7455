It then uses conditional statements to check for equality between the numbers and increments the count accordingly. Finally, it returns the total count of equal numbers. The provided solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n    count = 0\n    if a == b:\n        count += 1\n    if b == c:\n        count += 1\n    if a == c:\n        count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe provided solution defines a function `test_three_equal` that takes three integers as input and returns the count of equal numbers.
