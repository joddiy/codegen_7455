Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find tuples which have all elements divisible by k from the given list of tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_tuples([(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], 6) == [(6, 24, 12)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_tuples(tuples, k):\n    result = []\n    for tup in tuples:\n        if all(x % k == 0 for x in tup):\n            result.append(tup)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `find_tuples` function iterates through the given list of tuples and checks if all elements in each tuple are divisible by k.
