Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_difference(tuples):\n    min_val = float('inf')\n    max_diff = 0\n    for a, b in tuples:\n        if a < min_val:\n            min_val = a\n        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - min_val)\n    return max_diff\n```\nThe `max_difference` function iterates through the given tuple list, keeping track of the minimum value encountered so far and updating the maximum difference accordingly.
