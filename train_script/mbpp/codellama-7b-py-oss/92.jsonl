Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove all elements from a given list present in another list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    return [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]\n```\n\nThe `remove_elements` function takes two lists as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out the elements present in the second list from the first list.
