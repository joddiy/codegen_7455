Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\nfrom itertools import combinations, chain\n\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, len(tuple_list) + 1):\n        for comb in combinations(tuple_list, i):\n            sums = list(chain.from_iterable(comb))\n            for j in range(1, len(comb) + 1):\n                for c in combinations(comb, j):\n                    result.append(tuple(chain.from_iterable(c)))\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `find_combinations` function takes a list of tuples as input and uses the `itertools` module to find all combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list.
