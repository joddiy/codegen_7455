Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sum the length of the names of a given list of names after removing the names that start with a lowercase letter. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sample_nam(['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith'])==16\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef sample_nam(names):\n    total_length = 0\n    for name in names:\n        if name[0].islower():\n            continue\n        total_length += len(name)\n    return total_length\n```\nThe `sample_nam` function iterates through the list of names, skipping any name that starts with a lowercase letter.
