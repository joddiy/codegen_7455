It achieves this by left-shifting 1 by the number of bits in `n` minus 1, and then performing a bitwise OR with `n`. This effectively sets all even bits of the number `n`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    return n | (1 << (n.bit_length() - 1))\n```\n\nThe `even_bit_set_number` function takes a number `n` as input and uses the bitwise OR operator `|` to set all even bits of the number.
