Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    consecutive_count = 1\n    for i in range(1, len(lst)):\n        if lst[i] == lst[i-1] + 1:\n            consecutive_count += 1\n        else:\n            consecutive_count = 1\n        if consecutive_count == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\nThe `check_Consecutive` function iterates through the given list and checks for consecutive numbers.
