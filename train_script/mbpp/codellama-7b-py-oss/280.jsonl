Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")==('216.8.94.196')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address):\n    parts = ip_address.split('.')\n    cleaned_parts = [str(int(part)) for part in parts]\n    return '.'.join(cleaned_parts)\n```\n\nThe `removezero_ip` function splits the input `ip_address` into its parts using the dot as a delimiter.
