Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    dissimilar_elements = tuple(set(tuple1) - set(tuple2)) + tuple(set(tuple2) - set(tuple1))\n    return dissimilar_elements\n```\n\nThe `find_dissimilar` function takes two tuples as input and uses set operations to find the dissimilar elements.
