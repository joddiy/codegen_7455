Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):\n        sum += i**3\n    return sum\n```\nThe `cube_Sum` function iterates through the first n even natural numbers, calculates the cube of each number, and accumulates the sum.
