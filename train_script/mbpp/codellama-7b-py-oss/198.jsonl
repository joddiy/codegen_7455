Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Average_Of_Cube(2) == 4.5\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += i ** 3\n    return total / (n ** 3)\n```\nThe `find_Average_Of_Cube` function calculates the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.
