Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return (m - 1) * (m - 2) // 2\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `get_total_number_of_sequences` that takes in two positive integers `m` and `n`.
