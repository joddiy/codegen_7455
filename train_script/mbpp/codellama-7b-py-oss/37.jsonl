Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef get_Char(s):\n    total = 0\n    for char in s:\n        total += ord(char)\n    total = total % 26\n    return chr(total + 96) if total < 26 else chr(total - 26 + 96)\n```\n\nThe `get_Char` function iterates through each character in the input string, calculates the sum of their ASCII values, and then finds the character made by adding the sum of ASCII values modulo 26.
