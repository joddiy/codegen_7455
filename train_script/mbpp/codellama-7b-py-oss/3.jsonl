Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    diff = num1 ^ num2  # Calculate the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2\n    count_set_bits = 0  # Initialize the count of set bits\n    while diff:\n        count_set_bits += diff & 1  # Count the number of set bits in diff\n        diff >>= 1  # Right shift diff to check the next bit\n    return count_set_bits == 1  # Return True if the count is 1, False otherwise\n```\n\nThe `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` function calculates the bitwise XOR of the input numbers and then counts the number of set bits in the result.
