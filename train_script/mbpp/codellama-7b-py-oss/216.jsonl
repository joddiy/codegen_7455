Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the ration of positive numbers in an array of integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert positive_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8])==0.54\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef positive_count(arr):\n    positive_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num > 0)\n    total_count = len(arr)\n    ratio = positive_count / total_count\n    return ratio\n```\n\nThe `positive_count` function iterates through the input array and counts the number of positive numbers.
