It checks if the character 'z' is present in the string, except at the start and end, using the slicing notation `text[1:-1]`. If 'z' is found in this portion of the string, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(text):\n    if 'z' in text[1:-1]:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThe provided solution defines a function `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a string `text` as input.
