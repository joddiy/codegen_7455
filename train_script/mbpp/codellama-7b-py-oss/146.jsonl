Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) ) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count_first_elements(tup):\n    count = 0\n    for element in tup:\n        if not isinstance(element, tuple):\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            count += len(element)\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_first_elements` function iterates through the elements of the input tuple `tup`.
