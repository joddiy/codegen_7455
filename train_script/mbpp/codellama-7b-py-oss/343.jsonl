Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given tuple has any none value or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef check_none(tup):\n    return any(x is None for x in tup)\n```\n\nThe `check_none` function takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses a generator expression within the `any` function to check if any element in the tuple is `None`.
