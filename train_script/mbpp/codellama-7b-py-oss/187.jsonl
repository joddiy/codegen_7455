Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to create the next bigger number by rearranging the digits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert rearrange_bigger(12)==21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef rearrange_bigger(num):\n    num_str = str(num)\n    digits = sorted(num_str, reverse=True)\n    next_bigger = int(''.join(digits))\n    return next_bigger\n```\nThe `rearrange_bigger` function takes a number as input, converts it to a string, sorts the digits in descending order, and then joins them back to form the next bigger number.
