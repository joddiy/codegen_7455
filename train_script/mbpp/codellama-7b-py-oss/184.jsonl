It then uses the built-in `min` function in Python to find the minimum of the two numbers and returns the result. This solution satisfies the given assertion as it correctly returns the minimum of the two numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum of two numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert minimum(1,2) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef minimum(a, b):\n    return min(a, b)\n```\n\nThe provided solution defines a function `minimum` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input.
