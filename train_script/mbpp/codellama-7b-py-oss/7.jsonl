If either occurrence is not found, it returns the original string.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_Occ(s, c):\n    first = s.find(c)\n    last = s.rfind(c)\n    if first != -1 and last != -1:\n        return s[:first] + s[first+1:last] + s[last+1:]\n    else:\n        return s\n```\n\nThe `remove_Occ` function takes a string `s` and a character `c` as input.
