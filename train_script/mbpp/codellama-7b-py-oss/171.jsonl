{"task_id": "Mbpp/311", "completion": "\n    ```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n    return n | (1 << (n.bit_length()))\n```\n\nThe `set_left_most_unset_bit` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses the bitwise OR operator `|` to set the left most unset bit in the binary representation of `n`. The expression `(1 << (n.bit_length()))` calculates the left most unset bit position by left-shifting 1 by the number of bits in `n` using the `bit_length` method. The result is then bitwise ORed with `n` to set the left most unset bit.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set the left most unset bit. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n    return n | (1 << (n.bit_length()))\n```\n\nThe `set_left_most_unset_bit` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses the bitwise OR operator `|` to set the left most unset bit in the binary representation of `n`.
