It iterates through the array, multiplying each element with the current product and taking the modulo of the result with `n`. Finally, it returns the product after processing all the elements. The provided assertion ensures that the function works as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the product of the array multiplication modulo n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product = (product * num) % n\n    return product\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) == 9\n```\nThe `find_remainder` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` as input.
