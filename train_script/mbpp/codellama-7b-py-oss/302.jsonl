Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to move all the numbers to the end of the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand') == 'Iloveyouthreethousand1143553000'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef move_num(s):\n    nums = [c for c in s if c.isdigit()]\n    alphas = [c for c in s if not c.isdigit()]\n    return ''.join(alphas) + ''.join(nums)\n```\nThe `move_num` function takes a string `s` as input and separates the digits from the non-digits using list comprehensions.
