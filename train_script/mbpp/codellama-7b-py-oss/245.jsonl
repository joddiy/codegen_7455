{"task_id": "Mbpp/479", "completion": "\n    ```python\ndef first_Digit(num):\n    return num // 10**(len(str(num))-1)\n```\nThe `first_Digit` function takes a number as input and returns the first digit of the number. It achieves this by using the `//` operator to perform integer division by 10 raised to the power of the length of the string representation of the number minus 1. This effectively extracts the first digit of the number. The provided assertion ensures that the function behaves as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the first digit of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_Digit(123) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef first_Digit(num):\n    return num // 10**(len(str(num))-1)\n```\nThe `first_Digit` function takes a number as input and returns the first digit of the number.
