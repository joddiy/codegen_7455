Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))==[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef average_tuple(tup):\n    avg_list = []\n    for t in tup:\n        avg_list.append(sum(t) / len(t))\n    return avg_list\n\n# Test the function\nassert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]\n```\n\nThe `average_tuple` function takes a tuple of tuples as input and calculates the average value for each tuple, returning the results as a list.
