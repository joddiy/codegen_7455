It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` as per the definition of a prime number. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if any of them divides `n` evenly. If it finds such a number, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If no such number is found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
