Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    result = ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `remove_length` function takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input.
