Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef add_tuple(lst, tup):\n    lst.extend(tup)\n    return lst\n\n# Test the function\nassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n```\n\nThe `add_tuple` function takes a list and a tuple as input and extends the list with the elements of the tuple using the `extend` method.
