Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(arr[i] - arr[j]))\n    return max_diff\n```\n\nThe `max_Abs_Diff` function iterates through the array and calculates the absolute difference between each pair of elements.
