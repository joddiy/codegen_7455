Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert bell_number(2)==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef bell_number(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sum(bell_number(i) * bell_number(n - i) for i in range(1, n))\n\ndef count_partitions(n):\n    return bell_number(n)\n\nassert count_partitions(2) == 2\n```\n\nThe `bell_number` function calculates the nth Bell number using the definition of the Bell numbers.
