It initializes `min_val` with the first element of the list and then compares subsequent elements to find the minimum value.

Finally, it returns the minimum value found in the list.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef min_val(lst):\n    min_val = lst[0]\n    for i in lst:\n        if isinstance(i, (int, float)) and i < min_val:\n            min_val = i\n    return min_val\n```\n\nThe `min_val` function iterates through the given list and compares the elements to find the minimum value.
