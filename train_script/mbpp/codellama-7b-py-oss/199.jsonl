For each element, it extracts the last character using the index `-1` and appends it to a new list, which is then returned. This solution satisfies the given assertion and correctly extracts the rear index element of each string in the tuple.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef extract_rear(tup):\n    return [elem[-1] for elem in tup]\n```\n\nThe `extract_rear` function takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate through each element of the tuple.
