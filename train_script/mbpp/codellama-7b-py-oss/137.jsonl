The function uses a list `star_numbers` to store the sequence of star numbers and returns the n'th element of the list, which represents the n'th star number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the n'th star number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_star_num(3) == 37\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_star_num(n):\n    # Define the sequence of star numbers\n    star_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946]\n    \n    # Return the n'th star number\n    return star_numbers[n-1]\n```\n\nThe `find_star_num` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n'th star number from the sequence defined in the problem description.
