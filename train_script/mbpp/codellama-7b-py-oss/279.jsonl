Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef sum_Of_product(n):\n    s = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        s += i * (i-1)\n    return s\n\n# Test the function\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\nThe `sum_Of_product` function calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
