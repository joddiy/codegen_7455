If the input list is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes `min_length` with the length of the first list in the input list. Then, it iterates through the remaining lists and updates `min_length` if a smaller length is found.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):\n    if not list_of_lists:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        min_length = len(list_of_lists[0])\n        for lst in list_of_lists:\n            if len(lst) < min_length:\n                min_length = len(lst)\n        return min_length\n```\n\nThe `Find_Min_Length` function iterates through the list of lists and finds the length of the smallest list.
