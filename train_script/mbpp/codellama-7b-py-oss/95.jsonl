Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_char_position(\"xbcefg\") == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count_char_position(s):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i].lower() == chr(97 + i % 26).lower():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_char_position` function iterates through the characters of the input string `s`.
