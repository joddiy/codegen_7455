It achieves this by comparing the length of the set of characters in the string with the length of the string itself. If the length of the set is 1, it means all the characters are the same, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s):\n    return len(set(s)) == 1\n```\n\nThe `all_Characters_Same` function takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all the characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise.
