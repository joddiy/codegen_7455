Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef min_product_tuple(lst):\n    min_product = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            product = lst[i][0] * lst[j][1]\n            if product < min_product:\n                min_product = product\n    return min_product\n\n# Test the function\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\nThe `min_product_tuple` function iterates through all pairs of tuples in the input list and calculates the product of the elements.
