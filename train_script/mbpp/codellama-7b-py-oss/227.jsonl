Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef Find_Min(lst):\n    min_length = len(lst[0])\n    min_index = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if len(lst[i]) < min_length:\n            min_length = len(lst[i])\n            min_index = i\n    return lst[min_index]\n```\nThe `Find_Min` function iterates through the input list `lst` and keeps track of the index of the sublist with the minimum length.
