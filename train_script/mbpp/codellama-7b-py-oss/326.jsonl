Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert power_base_sum(2,100)==115\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef power_base_sum(base, power):\n    result = 0\n    for _ in range(power):\n        result += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(base))\n        base *= base\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `power_base_sum` function takes the base and power as input and calculates the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power.
