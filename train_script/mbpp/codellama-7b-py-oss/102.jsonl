Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef check_type(tup):\n    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1\n```\n\nThe `check_type` function takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses a set comprehension to find the unique types of elements in the tuple.
