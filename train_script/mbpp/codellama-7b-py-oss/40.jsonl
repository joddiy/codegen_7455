{"task_id": "Mbpp/86", "completion": "\n    ```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n    return ((2 * n - 1) ** 2) // 3\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number. The formula for calculating the nth centered hexagonal number is ((2 * n - 1) ** 2) // 3, which can be simplified to (2 * n - 1) ** 2 // 3. This formula accurately calculates the nth centered hexagonal number based on the provided formula.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find nth centered hexagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n    return ((2 * n - 1) ** 2) // 3\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number.
