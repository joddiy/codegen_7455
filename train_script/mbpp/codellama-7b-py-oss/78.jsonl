Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_occurrences(arr):\n    frequency = {}\n    max_freq = 0\n    max_item = None\n    \n    for item in arr:\n        if item in frequency:\n            frequency[item] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[item] = 1\n        \n        if frequency[item] > max_freq:\n            max_freq = frequency[item]\n            max_item = item\n    \n    return max_item\n```\n\nThe `max_occurrences` function initializes an empty dictionary `frequency` to store the frequency of each item in the input list.
