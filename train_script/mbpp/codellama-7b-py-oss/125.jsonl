Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count_integer(lst):\n    count = 0\n    for item in lst:\n        if isinstance(item, int):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_integer` function iterates through the given list and increments the count whenever it encounters an integer element.
