Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s):\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            return char\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    return None\n```\n\nThe `first_repeated_char` function iterates through the characters of the input string `s`.
