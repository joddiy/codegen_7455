Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to get the difference between two lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    return [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]\n```\n\nThe `Diff` function takes two lists as input and uses list comprehension to filter out the elements from the first list that are present in the second list.
