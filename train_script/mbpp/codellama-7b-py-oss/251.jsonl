Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr, k):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        if i >= k:\n            current_sum -= arr[i - k]\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    return max_sum\n```\nThe `max_sub_array_sum` function iterates through the input list `arr` and calculates the sum of the largest contiguous sublist of size `k`.
