Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the next perfect square greater than a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef next_Perfect_Square(num):\n    # Find the next perfect square greater than the given number\n    while True:\n        num += 1\n        root = int(num ** 0.5)\n        if root * root == num:\n            return num\n```\n\nThe `next_Perfect_Square` function iterates through numbers starting from the given number and finds the next perfect square by incrementing the number and checking if it's a perfect square.
