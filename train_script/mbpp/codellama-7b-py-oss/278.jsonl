It first checks if the list has at least two elements. If so, it creates a new list with the first element as the last element, the elements in between as they are, and the last element as the first element. This effectively interchanges the first and last elements in the list.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        return lst\n    else:\n        return [lst[-1], *lst[1:-1], lst[0]]\n```\n\nThe `swap_List` function takes a list as input and returns a new list with the first and last elements interchanged.
