Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef and_tuples(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(t1[i] & t2[i] for i in range(len(t1)))\n```\n\nThe `and_tuples` function takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` as input and uses a generator expression to create a new tuple by performing the bitwise AND operation elementwise between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
