Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    even_index = 0\n    odd_index = 0\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:\n            even_index = i\n            break\n    for i in range(even_index + 1, len(numbers)):\n        if numbers[i] % 2 != 0:\n            odd_index = i\n            break\n    return numbers[odd_index] - numbers[even_index]\n```\n\nThe `diff_even_odd` function iterates through the given list of numbers to find the first even and first odd numbers.
