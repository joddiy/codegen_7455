It uses recursion to calculate the sum of the first n perrin numbers. If n is 0, it returns 0. If n is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n-1 and adds n to the result.

Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cal_sum(9) == 49\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef cal_sum(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return cal_sum(n-1) + n\n```\n\nThe `cal_sum` function calculates the sum of perrin numbers.
