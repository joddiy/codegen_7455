Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef add_pairwise(tup):\n    result = ()\n    for i in range(len(tup) - 1):\n        result += (tup[i] + tup[i + 1],)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `add_pairwise` function takes a tuple `tup` as input and iterates through the elements, adding the neighboring elements to form a new tuple `result`.
