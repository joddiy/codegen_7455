Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert difference(3) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef difference(n):\n    sum_of_cubes = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6\n    sum_of_numbers = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers\n```\nThe `difference` function calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formulas for the sums of cubes and sums of numbers.
