Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether any value in a sequence exists in a sequence or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    return any(elem in seq2 for elem in seq1)\n```\n\nThe `overlapping` function takes two sequences as input and uses a generator expression to check if any element of the first sequence exists in the second sequence.
