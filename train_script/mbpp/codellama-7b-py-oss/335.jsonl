It uses bitwise AND and XOR operations to toggle the bits of the number except the first and the last bit. The function returns the modified number as the output. The provided assertion ensures that the function behaves as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n):\n    # Toggle the bits of the number except the first and the last bit\n    return (n & 0b1111111011111111) ^ 0b0000000100000000\n```\n\nThe provided solution defines a function `toggle_middle_bits` that takes an integer `n` as input.
