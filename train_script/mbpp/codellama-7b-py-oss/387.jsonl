It then uses a generator expression to iterate through the range from `l` to `r+1` (inclusive) and filters out the odd numbers using the condition `i % 2 != 0`. Finally, it returns the sum of the filtered odd numbers. This solution satisfies the given assertion and correctly calculates the sum of odd numbers within the specified range.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef sum_in_range(l, r):\n    return sum(i for i in range(l, r+1) if i % 2 != 0)\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `sum_in_range` that takes two parameters `l` and `r`, representing the lower and upper bounds of the range.
