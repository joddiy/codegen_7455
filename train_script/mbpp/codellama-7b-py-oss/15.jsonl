Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef check(num):\n    num_str = str(num)\n    num_reverse = int(num_str[::-1])\n    return num == num_reverse - 2\n```\n\nThe `check` function takes a number as input and converts it to a string to reverse it.
