It first handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 0 and 1 respectively. For `n` greater than 1, it recursively calculates the nth number in the newman conway sequence using the formula `sequence(n-1) + sequence(n-2) + sequence(n-3)`.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sequence(n-1) + sequence(n-2) + sequence(n-3)\n```\nThe solution defines a function `sequence` that takes an integer `n` as input.
