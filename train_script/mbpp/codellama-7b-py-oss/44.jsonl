Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert len_log([\"python\",\"PHP\",\"bigdata\"]) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef len_log(lst):\n    return max(len(word) for word in lst)\n```\n\nThe `len_log` function takes a list of words as input and uses a generator expression to find the length of the longest word in the list.
