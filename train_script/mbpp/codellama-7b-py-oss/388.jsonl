Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of an array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef _sum(arr):\n    return sum(arr)\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `_sum` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the sum of its elements using the built-in `sum` function.
