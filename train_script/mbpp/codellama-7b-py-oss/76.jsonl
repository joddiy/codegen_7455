Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert long_words(3,\"python is a programming language\")==['python','programming','language']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef long_words(n, sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    long_words_list = [word for word in words if len(word) > n]\n    return long_words_list\n```\n\nThe `long_words` function takes an integer `n` and a string `sentence` as input.
