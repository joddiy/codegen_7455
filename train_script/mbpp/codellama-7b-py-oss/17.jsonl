Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a, b):\n    return a < 0 and b > 0 or a > 0 and b < 0\n```\nThe `opposite_Signs` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns `True` if they have opposite signs, and `False` otherwise.
