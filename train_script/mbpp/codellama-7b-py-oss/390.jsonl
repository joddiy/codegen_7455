Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_all_spaces('python  program')==('pythonprogram')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_all_spaces(s):\n    return ''.join(s.split())\n```\n\nThe `remove_all_spaces` function takes a string `s` as input and uses the `split` method to split the string into a list of words, and then the `join` method to join the words back together without any whitespaces.
