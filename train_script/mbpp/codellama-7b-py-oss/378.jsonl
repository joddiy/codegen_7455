Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, val):\n    left, right = 0, len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < val:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\n\nThe `right_insertion` function takes an array `arr` and a value `val` as input.
