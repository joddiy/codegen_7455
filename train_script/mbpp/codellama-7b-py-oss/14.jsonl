If the number is divisible by both 3 and 8, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is woodball. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The provided assertion ensures that the function correctly identifies woodball numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef is_woodall(num):\n    # Check if the number is woodball\n    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 8 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThe `is_woodall` function takes a number as input and checks if it is woodball by verifying if the number is divisible by both 3 and 8.
