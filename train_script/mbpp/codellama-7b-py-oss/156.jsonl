Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef max_length(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n            max_list = sublist\n    return max_length, max_list\n\n# Test the function\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])\n```"}
