Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert snake_to_camel('python_program')=='PythonProgram'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef snake_to_camel(s):\n    words = s.split('_')\n    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])\n\n# Test the function\nassert snake_to_camel('python_program')=='PythonProgram'\n```\n\nThe `snake_to_camel` function splits the input string at the underscores and then capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first one.
