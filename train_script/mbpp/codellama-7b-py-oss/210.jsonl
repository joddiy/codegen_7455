Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to return the negative numbers in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef neg_nos(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums if num < 0]\n```\n\nThe `neg_nos` function takes a list of numbers as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out the negative numbers from the input list.
