If it finds a perfect square that equals `n`, it returns `False` as `n` cannot be represented as the difference of two squares. If no such square is found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if i*i == n:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\nThe `dif_Square` function iterates through the numbers from 1 to the square root of the given number `n`.
