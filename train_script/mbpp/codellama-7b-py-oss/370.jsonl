Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_sum(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    total = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if num not in seen:\n            seen.add(num)\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\nThe `find_sum` function initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the non-repeated elements and an integer `total` to store the sum.
