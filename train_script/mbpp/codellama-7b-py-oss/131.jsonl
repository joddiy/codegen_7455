Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Tuples must have the same length\")\n    \n    result_tuple = tuple(a / b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\n    return result_tuple\n```\n\nThe `division_elements` function takes in two tuples and performs element-wise division.
