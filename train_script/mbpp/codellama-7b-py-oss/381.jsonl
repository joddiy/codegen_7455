Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether every even index contains even numbers of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_position([3,2,1]) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThe `even_position` function iterates through the list `lst` starting from the even indices.
