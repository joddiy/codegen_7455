The `lambda` function checks if a character is alphabetic using the `isalpha` method. The `filter` function then returns a generator containing only the alphabetic characters, which are joined together to form the resulting string.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove odd characters in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_odd(\"python\")==(\"yhn\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef remove_odd(s):\n    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), s))\n```\n\nThe `remove_odd` function takes a string `s` as input and uses the `filter` function to remove all characters that are not alphabetic.
