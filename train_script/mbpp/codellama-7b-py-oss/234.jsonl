Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to drop empty items from a given dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})=={'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef drop_empty(d):\n    return {key: value for key, value in d.items() if value is not None}\n```\n\nThe `drop_empty` function iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `d`.
