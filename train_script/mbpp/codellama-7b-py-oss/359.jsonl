Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef find_min_diff(arr, k):\n    arr.sort()\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] - arr[i] < min_diff:\n                min_diff = arr[j] - arr[i]\n    return min_diff\n```\nThe `find_min_diff` function first sorts the input array.
