This solution satisfies the given assertion and correctly finds the `kth` element in the array.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef kth_element(arr, k):\n    return arr[k - 1]\n```\n\nThe `kth_element` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input.
