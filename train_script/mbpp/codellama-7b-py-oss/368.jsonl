Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')==('python', 0, 6)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef occurance_substring(string, substring):\n    if substring in string:\n        return (substring, string.index(substring), string.index(substring) + len(substring))\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nThe `occurance_substring` function takes a string and a substring as input.
