It first rotates the binary string by the given number of rotations. Then, it calculates the number of odd numbers in the rotated binary string and returns the count. The provided assertion ensures that the function behaves as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\n    binary_string = binary_string[rotations:] + binary_string[:rotations]\n    odd_count = sum(int(bit) for bit in binary_string)\n    return odd_count\n\n# Test the function\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\", 6) == 3\n```\n\nThe `odd_Equivalent` function takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input.
