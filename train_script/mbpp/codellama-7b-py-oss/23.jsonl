Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef recursive_list_sum(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for item in lst:\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            total += recursive_list_sum(item)\n        else:\n            total += item\n    return total\n\nassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21\n```\n\nThe `recursive_list_sum` function takes a list as input and iterates through its elements.
