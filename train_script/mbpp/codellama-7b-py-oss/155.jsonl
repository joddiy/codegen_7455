Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):\n        sum += i**2\n    return sum\n```\nThe `square_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
