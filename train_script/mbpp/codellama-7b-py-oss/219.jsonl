Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find cubes of individual elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef cube_nums(nums):\n    return [num**3 for num in nums]\n```\n\nThe `cube_nums` function takes a list of numbers as input and uses a list comprehension to calculate the cube of each number. The resulting list of cubes is then returned as the output. This solution satisfies the given assertion by correctly finding the cubes of the input numbers."}
