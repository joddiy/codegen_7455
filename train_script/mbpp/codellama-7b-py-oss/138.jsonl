{"task_id": "Mbpp/269", "completion": "\n ```python\ndef ascii_value(char):\n    return ord(char)\n```\n\nThe `ascii_value` function takes a character as input and returns its ascii value using the `ord` function. The `ord` function returns the Unicode code point of a character as an integer. This solution satisfies the given assertion by returning the correct ascii value for the input character 'A'.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the ascii value of a character. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert ascii_value('A')==65\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n ```python\ndef ascii_value(char):\n    return ord(char)\n```\n\nThe `ascii_value` function takes a character as input and returns its ascii value using the `ord` function.
