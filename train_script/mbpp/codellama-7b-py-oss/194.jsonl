It initializes `max_length` to 0 and `max_element` to an empty list. Then, for each element in the input list, it compares its length with the current `max_length`. If the length of the current element is greater than the `max_length`, it updates `max_length` and `max_element` accordingly.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef Find_Max(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_element = []\n    for element in lst:\n        if len(element) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(element)\n            max_element = element\n    return max_element\n```\n\nThe `Find_Max` function iterates through the input list `lst` and keeps track of the element with the maximum length encountered so far.
