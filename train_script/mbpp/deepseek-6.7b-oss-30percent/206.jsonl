Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    return len(set1.intersection(set2)) > 0\n```\nThe `common_element` function first converts the input lists into sets to efficiently check for common elements.
