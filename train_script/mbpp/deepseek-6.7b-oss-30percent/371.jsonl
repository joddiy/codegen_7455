Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])==[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    result = []\n    current_sublist = [lst[0]]\n    for i in range(1, len(lst)):\n        if lst[i] == lst[i-1]:\n            current_sublist.append(lst[i])\n        else:\n            result.append(current_sublist)\n            current_sublist = [lst[i]]\n    result.append(current_sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `pack_consecutive_duplicates` function iterates through the input list, maintaining a current sublist of consecutive duplicates.
