Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_nested(tup):\n    return tuple(x for x in tup if not isinstance(x, tuple))\n```\n\nThe `remove_nested` function takes a tuple as input and uses a generator expression to filter out any nested tuples.
