Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_bidirectional([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)] ) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_bidirectional(tuples):\n    bidirectional_count = 0\n    seen = set()\n    for t in tuples:\n        if t not in seen and (t[1], t[0]) in seen:\n            bidirectional_count += 1\n        seen.add(t)\n    return bidirectional_count\n```"}
