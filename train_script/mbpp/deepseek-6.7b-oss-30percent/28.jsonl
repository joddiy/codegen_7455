Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find whether all the given tuples have equal length or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    lengths = [len(t) for t in tuples]\n    return len(set(lengths)) == 1\n```\n\nThe `get_equal` function takes a list of tuples as input and uses a list comprehension to extract the lengths of each tuple.
