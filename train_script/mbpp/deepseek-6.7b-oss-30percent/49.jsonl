It initializes `min_length` to the length of the first list in the input list and then iterates through the rest of the lists to find the minimum length. If the input list is empty, it returns 0.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return 0\n    min_length = len(lst[0])\n    for sublist in lst:\n        min_length = min(min_length, len(sublist))\n    return min_length\n```\nThe `Find_Min_Length` function takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list in the input list.
