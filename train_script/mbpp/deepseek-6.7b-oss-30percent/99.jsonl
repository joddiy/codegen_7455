It then uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the list within the specified range, which is obtained using slicing. The assertion provided in the problem description is then checked to ensure that the function returns the expected result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_range_list(lst, start, end):\n    return sum(lst[start:end+1])\n```\nThe `sum_range_list` function takes a list `lst`, a start index `start`, and an end index `end` as input.
