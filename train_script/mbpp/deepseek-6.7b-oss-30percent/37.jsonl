Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_Char(s):\n    total = 0\n    for char in s:\n        total += ord(char)\n    return chr(total % 26 + ord('a'))\n```\nThe `get_Char` function takes a string `s` as input and calculates the sum of the ASCII values of its characters.
