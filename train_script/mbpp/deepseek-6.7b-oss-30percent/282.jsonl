It iterates through the strings and counts the number of positions where the characters are different. The function then returns this count as the minimum number of swaps required.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_Swaps(a, b):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if a[i] != b[i]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe `min_Swaps` function takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to convert `a` to `b`.
