Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i . Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        if arr[j] > arr[i] and arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, arr[j] + max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, j, k))\n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThe `max_sum_increasing_subseq` function takes the input array `arr`, the length `n` of the array, the index `i`, and the index `k` as parameters.
