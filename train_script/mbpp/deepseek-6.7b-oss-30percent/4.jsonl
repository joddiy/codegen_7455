Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_char_long(string):\n    words = string.split()\n    result = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]\n    return result\n```\nThe `find_char_long` function takes a string as input and splits it into words.
