Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(num):\n    # Set all even bits of the given number\n    return num | 0xAAAAAAAA\n```\nThe `even_bit_set_number` function takes a number `num` as input and uses the bitwise OR operation with the number `0xAAAAAAAA` to set all even bits of the given number.
