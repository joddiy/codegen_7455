Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, value):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return left\n```\nThe `right_insertion` function uses binary search to find the right insertion point for the specified value in a sorted array.
