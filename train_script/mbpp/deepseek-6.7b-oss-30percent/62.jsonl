Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, num_rotations):\n    binary_string = binary_string * num_rotations\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(num_rotations):\n        if int(binary_string[i:i+len(binary_string)//num_rotations], 2) % 2 != 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe `odd_Equivalent` function takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input.
