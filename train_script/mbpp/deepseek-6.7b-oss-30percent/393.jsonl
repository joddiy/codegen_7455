Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    product = 1\n    for num in numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product % 2 == 0\n```\nThe `is_product_even` function iterates through the list of numbers and calculates their product.
