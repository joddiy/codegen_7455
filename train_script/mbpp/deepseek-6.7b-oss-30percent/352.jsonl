Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    We say that an element is common for lists l1, l2, l3 if it appears in all three lists under the same index. Write a function to find common elements from three lists. The function should return a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    common_elements = []\n    for i in range(len(l1)):\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            common_elements.append(l1[i])\n    return common_elements\n```\nThe `extract_index_list` function iterates through the lists l1, l2, and l3 simultaneously and checks if the elements at the same index are equal. If they are, the element is added to the `common_elements` list. Finally, the function returns the list of common elements."}
