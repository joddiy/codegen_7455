Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function takes as input two lists [a_1,...,a_n], [b_1,...,b_n] and returns [a_1+b_1,...,a_n+b_n]. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_list([10,20,30],[15,25,35])==[25,45,65]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_list(list1, list2):\n    return [a + b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n```\nThe `sum_list` function takes two lists as input and uses list comprehension to iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously and add them together.
