Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_lists(([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_lists(t):\n    count = 0\n    for item in t:\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `find_lists` function iterates through the elements of the given tuple and increments the count for each list encountered.
