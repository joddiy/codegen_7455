Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(flattened_list):\n    frequency = {}\n    for sublist in flattened_list:\n        for item in sublist:\n            if item in frequency:\n                frequency[item] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[item] = 1\n    return frequency\n```"}
