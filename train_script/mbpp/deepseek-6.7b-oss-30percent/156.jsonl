Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_length(lst):\n    max_len = 0\n    max_lst = []\n    for sublst in lst:\n        if len(sublst) > max_len:\n            max_len = len(sublst)\n            max_lst = sublst\n    return max_len, max_lst\n```\nThe `max_length` function iterates through the list of lists and finds the list with the maximum length.
