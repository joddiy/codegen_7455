Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(num1, num2):\n    return (num1 ^ num2) < 0\n```\nThe `opposite_Signs` function takes two integers `num1` and `num2` as input and uses bitwise XOR (`^`) to check if their signs are opposite.
