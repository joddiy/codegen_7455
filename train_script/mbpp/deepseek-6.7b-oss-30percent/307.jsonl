If the radius is negative, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the area using the formula for the area of a triangle inscribed in a semicircle and returns the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert triangle_area(-1) == None\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(radius):\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        area = (radius ** 2) * math.pi / 2\n        return area\n```\n\nThe `triangle_area` function takes the radius of the semicircle as input and calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in the semicircle.
