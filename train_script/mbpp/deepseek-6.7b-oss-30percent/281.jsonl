Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(lst):\n    even_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]\n    odd_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]\n    return even_numbers[0] - odd_numbers[0]\n```\nThe `diff_even_odd` function first filters the list to separate even and odd numbers.
