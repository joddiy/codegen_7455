Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    dissimilar_elements = []\n    for element in tuple1:\n        if element not in tuple2:\n            dissimilar_elements.append(element)\n    for element in tuple2:\n        if element not in tuple1:\n            dissimilar_elements.append(element)\n    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)\n```\nThe `find_dissimilar` function iterates through the elements of the first tuple and appends any elements that are not present in the second tuple to the `dissimilar_elements` list.
