Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    max_prod = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] > arr[i]:\n                max_prod = max(max_prod, arr[i] * arr[j])\n    return max_prod\n```\nThe `max_product` function iterates through the array and finds the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence.
