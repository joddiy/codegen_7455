Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_integer(lst):\n    return len([x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)])\n```\n\nThe `count_integer` function takes a list `lst` as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out the integer elements from the list.
