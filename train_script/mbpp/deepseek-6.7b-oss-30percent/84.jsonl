Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return True  # 0 can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2\n    while n > 0:\n        if n & 1:  # Check if the least significant bit is 1\n            n >>= 1  # Right shift to check the next bit\n        else:\n            return False  # If the least significant bit is 0, then n cannot be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2\n    return True  # If the loop completes without returning False, then n can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2\n```"}
