Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_even(t):\n    return tuple(x for x in t if isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 == 0)\n```\nThe `extract_even` function takes a tuple `t` as input and uses a generator expression to filter out the even integers from the tuple.
