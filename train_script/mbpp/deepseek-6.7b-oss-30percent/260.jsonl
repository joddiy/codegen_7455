Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sort_sublists([['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']])==[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(lst):\n    sorted_sublists = []\n    for sublist in lst:\n        sorted_sublists.append(sorted(sublist))\n    return sorted_sublists\n```\nThe `sort_sublists` function takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted.
