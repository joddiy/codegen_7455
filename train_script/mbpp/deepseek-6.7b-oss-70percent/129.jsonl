Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        max_element = max(tuple1[i] + tuple2[i])\n        result.append(max_element)\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThe `maximize_elements` function takes two tuples as input and iterates through each element of the tuples to find the maximum element.
