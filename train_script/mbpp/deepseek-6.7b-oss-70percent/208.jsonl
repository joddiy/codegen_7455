Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr, num):\n    for element in arr:\n        if num <= element:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\nThe `check_greater` function iterates through the elements of the array and checks if the entered number is greater than each element.
