Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    return tuple(min(x, y) for x, y in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\n```\nThe `and_tuples` function takes two tuples as input and uses a generator expression to create a new tuple containing the minimum values from the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
