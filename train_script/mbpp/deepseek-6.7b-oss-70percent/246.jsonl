Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Split(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n```\nThe `Split` function takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers.
