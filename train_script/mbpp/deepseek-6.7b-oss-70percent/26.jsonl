Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_Monotonic(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 2:\n        return True\n    increasing = decreasing = True\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:\n            increasing = False\n        if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:\n            decreasing = False\n    return increasing or decreasing\n```\nThe `is_Monotonic` function first checks if the array has at most 2 elements, in which case it is trivially monotonic.
