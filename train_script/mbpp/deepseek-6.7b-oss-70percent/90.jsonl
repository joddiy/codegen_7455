Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[j])\n            if diff > max_diff:\n                max_diff = diff\n    return max_diff\n\n# Test the function\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```"}
