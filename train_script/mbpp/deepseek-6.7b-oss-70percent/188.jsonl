Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(tuples_list):\n    min_product = float('inf')  # Initialize min_product with positive infinity\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        product = tup[0] * tup[1]  # Calculate the product of the current tuple\n        if product < min_product:\n            min_product = product  # Update min_product if a smaller product is found\n    return min_product\n```\nThe `min_product_tuple` function iterates through the list of tuples and calculates the product of each tuple.
