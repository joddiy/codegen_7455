Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)] ) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_freq(lst):\n    unique_tuples = set(lst)\n    return len(unique_tuples)\n```\nThe `extract_freq` function takes a list of tuples as input and uses a set to store the unique tuples. It then returns the length of the set, which represents the number of unique tuples in the input list."}
