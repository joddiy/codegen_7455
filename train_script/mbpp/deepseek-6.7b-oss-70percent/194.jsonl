Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Max(lst):\n    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if len(sublist) == max_len:\n            return sublist\n```\nThe `Find_Max` function first finds the maximum length of a sublist in the input list `lst`.
