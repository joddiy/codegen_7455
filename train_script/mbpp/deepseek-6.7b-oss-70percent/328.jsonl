Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(t):\n    return tuple(t[i] * t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1))\n```\nThe `multiply_elements` function takes a tuple `t` as input and uses a generator expression to create a new tuple containing the product of adjacent elements.
