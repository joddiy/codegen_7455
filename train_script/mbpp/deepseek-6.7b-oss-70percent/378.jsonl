It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the array. It then enters a while loop, where it calculates the middle index `mid` and compares the value at `mid` with the given `value`. If the value at `mid` is less than the given `value`, it updates `left` to `mid + 1`; otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`. This process continues until `left` becomes equal to `right`, at which point the function returns `left` as the right insertion point for the given value.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, value):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\nThe `right_insertion` function takes a sorted array `arr` and a value `value` as input.
