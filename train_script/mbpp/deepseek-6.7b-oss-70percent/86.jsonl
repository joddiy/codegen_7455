Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)])) == set([3, 4, 5, 7, 1])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_singly(list_of_lists):\n    return [item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist]\n```\nThe `extract_singly` function takes a list of lists as input and uses a list comprehension to flatten the list of lists into a single list of numbers.
