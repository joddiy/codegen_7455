Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef dif_Square(num):\n    for i in range(num):\n        for j in range(num):\n            if i**2 - j**2 == num:\n                return True\n    return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\nThe `dif_Square` function iterates through all possible combinations of i and j, and checks if the difference of their squares is equal to the given number.
