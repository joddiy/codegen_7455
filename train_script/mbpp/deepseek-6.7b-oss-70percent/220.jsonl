Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cal_sum(9) == 49\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef cal_sum(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 3\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 5\n    else:\n        perrin_numbers = [3, 5]\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            next_number = perrin_numbers[i-2] + perrin_numbers[i-1]\n            perrin_numbers.append(next_number)\n        return sum(perrin_numbers)\n```\nThe `cal_sum` function calculates the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers using a list to store the numbers and then returns the sum.
