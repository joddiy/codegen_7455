Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge_sorted_list([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110],[19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154],[24, 26, 54, 48])==[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):\n    merged_list = list1 + list2 + list3\n    merged_list.sort()\n    return merged_list\n```\nThe `merge_sorted_list` function takes three lists as input, concatenates them, and then sorts the resulting list to produce the sorted merged list.
