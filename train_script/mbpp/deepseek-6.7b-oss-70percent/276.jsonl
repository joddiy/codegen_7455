Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    return [x**2 for x in range(1, end+1) if x**2 >= start and x**2 <= end]\n```\nThe `perfect_squares` function takes two numbers `start` and `end` as input and returns a list of perfect squares between `start` and `end`.
