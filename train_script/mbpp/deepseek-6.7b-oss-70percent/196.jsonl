It uses a generator expression to calculate the cubes of the even numbers and then sums them up using the `sum` function. The assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` ensures that the function works as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    return sum(i**3 for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2))\n```\nThe `cube_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
