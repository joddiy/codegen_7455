It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the array. It then enters a while loop, where it calculates the middle index `mid` and compares the value at `arr[mid]` with the given `value`. If `arr[mid]` is less than the `value`, it updates `left` to `mid + 1`; otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`. This process continues until `left` becomes equal to `right`, at which point the function returns `left`, which represents the left insertion point for the given value in the sorted array.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/data-structures-and-algorithms/python-data-structure-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, value):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\nThe `left_insertion` function takes a sorted array `arr` and a value `value` as input.
