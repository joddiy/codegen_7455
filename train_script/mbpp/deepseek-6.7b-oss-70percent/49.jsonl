Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):\n    if list_of_lists:\n        min_length = len(list_of_lists[0])\n        for sublist in list_of_lists:\n            if len(sublist) < min_length:\n                min_length = len(sublist)\n        return min_length\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\nThe `Find_Min_Length` function takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list in the input list.
