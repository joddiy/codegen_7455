Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given tuples contain the k or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_K(tuple_input, k):\n    return k in tuple_input\n```\nThe `check_K` function takes a tuple `tuple_input` and an integer `k` as input. It returns `True` if `k` is present in the tuple, and `False` otherwise. The assertion provided in the problem description ensures that the function behaves as expected."}
