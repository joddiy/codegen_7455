Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(lst):\n    even_num = next((num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0), None)\n    odd_num = next((num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0), None)\n    if even_num and odd_num:\n        return even_num * odd_num\n    else:\n        return \"No even or odd numbers found in the list\"\n```\nThe `mul_even_odd` function takes a list as input and finds the first even and odd numbers in the list.
