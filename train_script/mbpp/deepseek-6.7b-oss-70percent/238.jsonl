It first sorts the input list and then checks if the sorted list is equal to the range of numbers from the minimum value to the maximum value in the list. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers; otherwise, it returns `False`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst) + 1))\n```\nThe `check_Consecutive` function takes a list `lst` as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.
