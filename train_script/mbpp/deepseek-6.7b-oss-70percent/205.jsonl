The directrix is the line that bisects the parabola at its vertex.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a, b, c):\n    return -4 * a * c\n```\nThe function `parabola_directrix` takes in the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of a parabola and returns the directrix of the parabola. The directrix is the line that bisects the parabola at its vertex."}
