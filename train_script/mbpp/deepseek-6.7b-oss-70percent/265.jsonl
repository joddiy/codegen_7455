It uses the property that the last digit in the factorial is the product of the last digits in the factorial of the individual numbers. The function iterates through the numbers from 2 to `n`, multiplying the last digit of the factorial with each number, and then taking the modulo 10 to get the last digit of the factorial.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        last_digit = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10\n        return last_digit\n```\nThe `last_Digit_Factorial` function calculates the last digit in the factorial of a given number `n`.
