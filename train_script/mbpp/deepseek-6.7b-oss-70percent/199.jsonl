The `-1` index accesses the last character of each string in the tuple. The resulting list of rear index elements is then returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_rear(tup):\n    return [word[-1] for word in tup]\n```\nThe `extract_rear` function takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses a list comprehension to extract the rear index element of each string in the tuple. The `-1` index accesses the last character of each string in the tuple. The resulting list of rear index elements is then returned."}
