Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to divide two lists element wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Lists must be of equal length\")\n    result = [x / y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `div_list` function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the element-wise division of the input lists.
