Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Substrings('112112') == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_Substrings(s):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i, len(s)):\n            substring = s[i:j+1]\n            if sum(int(digit) for digit in substring) == len(substring):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe `count_Substrings` function iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if the sum of digits in the substring is equal to the length of the substring.
