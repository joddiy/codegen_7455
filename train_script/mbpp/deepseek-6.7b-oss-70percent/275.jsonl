Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the difference between largest and smallest value in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert big_diff([1,2,3,4]) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef big_diff(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 2:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return max(nums) - min(nums)\n```\nThe `big_diff` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
