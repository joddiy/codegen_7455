Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    max_len = max(len(lst) for lst in list_of_lists)\n    max_list = [lst for lst in list_of_lists if len(lst) == max_len]\n    return max_len, max_list[0]\n```"}
