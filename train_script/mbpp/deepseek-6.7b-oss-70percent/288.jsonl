Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s):\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return None\n```\n\nThe `first_repeated_char` function iterates through the characters in the input string `s`.
