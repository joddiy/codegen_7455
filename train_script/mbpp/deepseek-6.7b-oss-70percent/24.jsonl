Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of positive numbers in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pos_count([1,-2,3,-4]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef pos_count(nums):\n    count = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num > 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe `pos_count` function iterates through the input list `nums` and increments the count for each positive number it encounters.
