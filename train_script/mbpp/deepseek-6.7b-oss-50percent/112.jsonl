The mask `0xAAAAAAAA` has all even bits set to 1 and all odd bits set to 0, so when it is bitwise ORed with the input number, it sets all even bits to 1 and leaves the odd bits unchanged. The resulting number is then returned as the output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(num):\n    # Set all even bits of the given number\n    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA  # 10101010101010101010101010101010 in binary\n    return num | mask\n```\n\nThe `even_bit_set_number` function takes an integer `num` as input and uses a bitwise OR operation with the mask `0xAAAAAAAA` to set all even bits of the input number.
