Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_Of_product(n):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            product *= (n-j+1) // j\n        result += product\n    return result\n```\nThe `sum_Of_product` function iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to `n` and calculates the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
