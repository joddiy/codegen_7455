Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    max_len = 0\n    max_list = []\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        if len(lst) > max_len:\n            max_len = len(lst)\n            max_list = lst\n    return max_len, max_list\n```"}
