Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(lst):\n    even_num = next((num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0), None)\n    odd_num = next((num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0), None)\n    return even_num - odd_num if even_num and odd_num else None\n```\nThe `diff_even_odd` function iterates through the list to find the first even and first odd numbers.
