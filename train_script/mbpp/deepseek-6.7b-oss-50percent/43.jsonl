Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the closest smaller number than n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert closest_num(11) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef closest_num(n):\n    if n < 10:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return n - 1\n```\nThe `closest_num` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the closest smaller number than `n`.
