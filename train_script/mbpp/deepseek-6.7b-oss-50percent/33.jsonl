Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find whether a number is divisible by 11. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Diff (12345) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_Diff(num):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    num_str = str(num)\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of odd and even digits\n    odd_sum = 0\n    even_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the digits of the number\n    for i in range(len(num_str)):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            odd_sum += int(num_str[i])\n        else:\n            even_sum += int(num_str[i])\n    \n    # Check if the difference between the sums is divisible by 11\n    return (odd_sum - even_sum) % 11 == 0\n```\n\nThe `is_Diff` function takes a number as input and checks if the difference between the sums of odd and even digits is divisible by 11.
