Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(lst):\n    even_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]\n    odd_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]\n    if even_numbers and odd_numbers:\n        return even_numbers[0] * odd_numbers[0]\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\nThe `mul_even_odd` function takes a list of numbers as input and finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in the list.
