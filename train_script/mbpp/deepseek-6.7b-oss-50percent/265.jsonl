It uses a simple mathematical property of factorials to calculate the last digit efficiently. The function iterates through the numbers from 2 to `n`, multiplying each number with the result obtained so far, and then taking the modulo 10 to get the last digit. This approach ensures that the result is always a single digit, as required.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            result = (result * i) % 10\n        return result\n```\nThe `last_Digit_Factorial` function takes a number `n` as input and returns the last digit in the factorial of `n`.
