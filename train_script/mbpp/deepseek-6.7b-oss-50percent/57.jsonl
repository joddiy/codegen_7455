If `n` is 0, the function returns 1. If `m` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `m`, as well as `n` and `m - 1`, and returns the sum of these two results.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef eulerian_num(n, m):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif m == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + eulerian_num(n, m - 1)\n```\nThe `eulerian_num` function uses the recursive definition of the Eulerian number to calculate the Eulerian number for the given `n` and `m`.
