Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if s[i:] + s[:i] == s:\n            return i\n    return 0\n```\nThe `find_Rotations` function iterates through the string `s` and checks if the substring starting from index `i` to the end of the string followed by the substring from the beginning to index `i` is equal to the original string `s`.
