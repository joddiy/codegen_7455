Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    return all(x < y for x, y in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\n```\nThe `check_smaller` function takes two tuples as input and uses a generator expression to check if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.
