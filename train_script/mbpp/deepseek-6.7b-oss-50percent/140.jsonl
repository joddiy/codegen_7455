Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and finds the sum of the first n even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        sum += (2*i)**5\n    return sum\n\n# Test the function\nassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056\n```"}
