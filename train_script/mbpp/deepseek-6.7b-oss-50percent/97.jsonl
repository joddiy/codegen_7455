If `n` is 0, it returns 1. Otherwise, it uses the `bit_length` method to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()\n```\nThe `next_power_of_2` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.
