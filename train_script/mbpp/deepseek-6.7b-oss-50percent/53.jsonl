It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and append the remainder to the binary string, until the decimal number becomes 0. Finally, it returns the binary string.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert the given decimal number to its binary equivalent, represented as a string with no leading zeros. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert decimal_to_binary(8) == '1000'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    if decimal == 0:\n        return '0'\n    binary = ''\n    while decimal > 0:\n        binary = str(decimal % 2) + binary\n        decimal = decimal // 2\n    return binary\n```\n\nThe `decimal_to_binary` function takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary equivalent as a string with no leading zeros.
