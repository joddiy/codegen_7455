Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort a list of tuples using the second value of each tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert subject_marks([('English', 88), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97), ('Social sciences', 82)])==[('Social sciences', 82), ('English', 88), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def subject_marks(subjects):\n        return sorted(subjects, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    ```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function subject_marks takes a list of tuples as an argument.
