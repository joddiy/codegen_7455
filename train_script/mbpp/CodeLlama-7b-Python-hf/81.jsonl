The sum function is then used to calculate the sum of the negative numbers in the list.\n\n    The function can be called as follows:\n```python\nsum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])\n```\n\n    ### Additional Resources:\n    * [List Comprehensions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp)\n    * [Sum](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sum.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)\n    * [Python Conditions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)\n    * [Python If-Else Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)\n    * [Python Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)\n    * [Python Ternary Operator](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)\n    * [Python Comparison Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)\n    * [Python Comparison Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)\n    * [Python for Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)\n    * [Python While Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)\n    * [Python Nested Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_nested_loops.asp)\n    * [Python Break Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_break.asp)\n    * [Python continue Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_continue.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Return Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Return Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n    * [Python Functions](https://www.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
