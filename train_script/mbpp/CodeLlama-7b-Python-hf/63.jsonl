It returns a list of common elements in the nested lists.\n\n    The function uses a list comprehension to create a list of sets from the nested lists. The function uses the built-in set intersection function to find the common elements.\n\n    The function uses the set intersection function to find the common elements. The function returns a list of common elements.\n\n    ### Example:\n    ```python\n    >>> common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]])\n    [12, 18]\n    ```\n\n    ### Additional Exercises:\n    - Write a function to find the common elements in given nested lists.
