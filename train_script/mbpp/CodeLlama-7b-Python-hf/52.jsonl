The `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError` if the condition is not true.\n\n    The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the two numbers are close to each other. The `rel_tol` parameter is used to set the relative tolerance.\n\n    The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list.\n\n    The `len` function is used to get the length of the list.\n\n    ### Example:\n    ```python\n    >>> multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7))\n    -67.2\n    ```\n\n    ### Additional Exercises:\n    - Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n    - Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
