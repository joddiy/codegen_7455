Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function which takes two tuples of the same length and performs the element wise modulo. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef tuple_modulo(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a % b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n\nassert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)\n```\n\nThe function `tuple_modulo` takes two tuples as input.
