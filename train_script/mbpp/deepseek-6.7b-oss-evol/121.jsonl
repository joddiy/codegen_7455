Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])==[1, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef intersection_array(arr1, arr2):\n    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n\nassert intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])==[1, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\nThe function `intersection_array` takes two arrays as input, converts them to sets, and then finds the intersection of the two sets.
