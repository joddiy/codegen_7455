It uses list slicing to create a new list that includes all elements from the original list except the `k`th element. The `k-1` is used as the stop index because list indices in Python start from 0.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list and returns a list with the same elements, but the k'th element removed. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(lst, k):\n    return lst[:k-1] + lst[k:]\n\nassert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]\n```\n\nThe function `remove_kth_element` takes a list and an integer `k` as input.
