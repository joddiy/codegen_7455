Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate the sum of the negative numbers of a given list of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])==-32\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_negativenum(num_list):\n    return sum(num for num in num_list if num < 0)\n\nassert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])==-32\n```\n\nThe function `sum_negativenum` takes a list of numbers as input.
