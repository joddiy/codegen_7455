Then, it checks if the number is less than or equal to 3, in which case it is prime. If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number up to the square root of the number, in which case it is not prime.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_not_prime(2) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return True\n    elif n <= 3:\n        return False\n    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return True\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return True\n        i += 6\n    return False\n\nassert is_not_prime(2) == False\n```\n\nThe function `is_not_prime` checks if a number is not prime by first checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime.
