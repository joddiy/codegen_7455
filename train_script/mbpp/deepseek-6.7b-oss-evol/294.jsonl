It initializes a 2D list `bell` with zeros, and then fills it up with the Bell numbers. The base case is `bell[0][0] = 1`, and then for each number `i` from 1 to `n`, it sets `bell[i][0]` to `bell[i-1][i-1]` and for each number `j` from 1 to `i`, it sets `bell[i][j]` to the sum of `bell[i-1][j-1]` and `bell[i][j-1]`.
