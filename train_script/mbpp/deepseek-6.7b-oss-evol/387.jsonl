Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l, r):\n    return sum(i for i in range(l, r+1) if i % 2 != 0)\n\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\nThis function works by using a generator expression to iterate over the range from l to r+1 (since the range function in Python stops one value before the end), and checks if each number is odd by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is not equal to 0.
