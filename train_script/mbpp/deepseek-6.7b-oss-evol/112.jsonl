Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    return n | 0b10101010101010101010101010101010\n\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `even_bit_set_number` takes an integer `n` as input.
