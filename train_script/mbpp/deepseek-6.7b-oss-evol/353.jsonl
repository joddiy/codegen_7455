It then iterates over the list of numbers. If it encounters a number that is smaller than or equal to `m1`, it updates `m1` and `m2`. If it encounters a number that is greater than `m1` but smaller than `m2`, it updates `m2`. Finally, it returns `m2`, which is the second smallest number in the list. The assertion at the end checks if the function works as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    m1, m2 = float('inf'), float('inf')\n    for x in numbers:\n        if x <= m1:\n            m1, m2 = x, m1\n        elif x < m2:\n            m2 = x\n    return m2\n\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\nThe function `second_smallest` initializes two variables `m1` and `m2` to positive infinity.
