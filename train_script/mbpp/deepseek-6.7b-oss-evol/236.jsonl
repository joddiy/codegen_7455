Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef add_pairwise(tup):\n    return tuple(tup[i] + tup[i+1] for i in range(len(tup)-1))\n\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\nThe function `add_pairwise` takes a tuple as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding element and the next element in the input tuple.
