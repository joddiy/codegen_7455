Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(string):\n    char_dict = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in char_dict:\n            return char\n        else:\n            char_dict[char] = 1\n    return None\n\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\nThe function `first_repeated_char` iterates over each character in the input string.
