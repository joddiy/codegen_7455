It uses the `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from the two lists. Then it uses a list comprehension to divide each pair of numbers. The result is a new list where each element is the result of the division of the corresponding elements in the input lists. The `assert` statement checks if the function is working as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to divide two lists element wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    return [a / b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\nThe function `div_list` takes two lists as input.
