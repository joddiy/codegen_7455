Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-products-of-all-possible-subarrays/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]) == 20\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        prod = 1\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            prod *= arr[j]\n            sum += prod\n    return sum\n\nassert sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]) == 20\n```\n\nThe function `sum_Of_Subarray_Prod` takes a list of integers as input.
