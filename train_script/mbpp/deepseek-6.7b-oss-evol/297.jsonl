Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef merge(lst):\n    return [list(i) for i in zip(*lst)]\n\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\nThe `zip()` function in Python takes iterable elements and aggregates them into a tuple.
