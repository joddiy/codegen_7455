The helper function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime by checking if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The function iterates over all numbers less than `n` and increments a counter for each prime number it finds. The counter is then returned as the result. The assertion at the end checks if the function works as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\n    def is_prime(num):\n        if num < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\nThe function `count_Primes_nums` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`.
