Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate a dog's age in dog's years. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dog_age(12)==61\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a simple Python function that calculates a dog's age in dog's years:\n\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_age):\n    return human_age * 7\n\n# Test the function\nassert dog_age(12)==61\n```\n\nThis function takes a human's age as input and returns the equivalent age in dog's years.
