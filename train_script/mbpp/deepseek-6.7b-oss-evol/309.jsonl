Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n\nassert find_even_numbers([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]\n```\n\nThe function `find_even_numbers` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and select only the numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers).
