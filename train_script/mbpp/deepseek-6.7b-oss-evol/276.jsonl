It does this by using a list comprehension to generate a list of squares of numbers in the range from the square root of `start` to the square root of `end`, inclusive. The `**0.5` operation is used to calculate the square root of a number, and the `int()` function is used to round down to the nearest integer. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given input and expected output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    return [i**2 for i in range(int(start**0.5), int(end**0.5)+1)]\n\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nThe function `perfect_squares` takes two arguments, `start` and `end`, and returns a list of perfect squares between them.
