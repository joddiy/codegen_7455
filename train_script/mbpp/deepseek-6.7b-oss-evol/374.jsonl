It iterates over each element in the array and calculates the number of subarrays that include the current element. This is done by multiplying the number of subarrays that start at the current element with the number of subarrays that end at the current element. The number of subarrays that start and end at the current element is calculated by adding 1 to the number of subarrays that start at the current element and the number of subarrays that end at the current element, and then dividing by 2. The sum of all elements in these subarrays is then calculated by multiplying the number of subarrays with the value of the current element. This sum is then added to the total sum.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function works correctly for the given example.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
