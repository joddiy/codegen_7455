This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the first n natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python.\n\nThe assertion `assert find_star_num(3) == 37` checks if the function `find_star_num(3)` returns the correct result, which is 37. If the function returns a different result, the assertion will raise an `AssertionError`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the n'th star number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_star_num(3) == 37\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_star_num(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nassert find_star_num(3) == 37\n```\n\nThe function `find_star_num(n)` calculates the n'th star number by using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
