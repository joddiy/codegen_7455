The assertion checks if the function works correctly by comparing the result of the function with the expected result. If the result is not as expected, the assertion will raise an AssertionError.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the area of a rectangle. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert rectangle_area(10,20)==200\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n\nassert rectangle_area(10,20)==200\n```\n\nThe function `rectangle_area` takes two parameters: `length` and `width`.
