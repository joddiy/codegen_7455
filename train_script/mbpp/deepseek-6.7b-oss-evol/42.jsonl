Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    freq_dict = {}\n    for i in lst:\n        if i in freq_dict:\n            freq_dict[i] += 1\n        else:\n            freq_dict[i] = 1\n    return freq_dict\n\nassert freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30])==({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})\n```\n\nThe function `freq_count` takes a list as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in the list and the values are their corresponding frequencies.
