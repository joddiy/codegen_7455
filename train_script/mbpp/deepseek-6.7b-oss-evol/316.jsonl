Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    The wind chill index is calculated using the formula:\n\n    wci = 13.12 + 0.6215*T - 11.37*V^0.16 + 0.3965*T*V^0.16\n\n    where T is the temperature in Celsius and V is the wind speed in km/h.\n\n    Here is a Python function that calculates the wind chill index:\n\n```python\ndef wind_chill(V, T):\n    wci = 13.12 + 0.6215*T - 11.37*(V**0.16) + 0.3965*T*(V**0.16)\n    return round(wci)\n\nassert wind_chill(120,35)==40\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: the wind speed in km/h and the temperature in Celsius.
