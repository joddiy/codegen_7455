Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove odd characters in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_odd(\"python\")==(\"yhn\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s):\n    return s[::2]\n\nassert remove_odd(\"python\")==(\"yhn\")\n```\n\nThe function `remove_odd` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that contains every other character of `s`.
