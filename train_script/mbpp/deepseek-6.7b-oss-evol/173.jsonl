Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n):\n    power = 1\n    while power <= n:\n        power *= 2\n    return power // 2\n\nassert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8\n```\n\nThis Python function works by starting with 1 and then doubling it in each iteration until it is greater than n.
