Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set the left most unset bit. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n | (n + 1)\n\nassert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14\n```\n\nThe function `set_left_most_unset_bit` takes an integer `n` as input.
