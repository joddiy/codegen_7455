Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert triangle_area(-1) == None\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(radius):\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        # The area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is given by the formula:\n        # Area = (r^2 * pi) / 2\n        return (radius ** 2 * math.pi) / 2\n\n# Testing the function\nassert triangle_area(-1) == None\nassert triangle_area(0) == 0\nassert triangle_area(1) == (1 ** 2 * math.pi) / 2\nassert triangle_area(2) == (2 ** 2 * math.pi) / 2\n```\n\nIn the above code, the function `triangle_area` takes the radius of the semicircle as input and returns the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in it.
