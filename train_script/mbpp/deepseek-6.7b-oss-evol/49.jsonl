Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lst):\n    return min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)\n\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\nThis Python function uses a generator expression to find the length of each sublist in the input list, and then uses the built-in min function to find the smallest length.
