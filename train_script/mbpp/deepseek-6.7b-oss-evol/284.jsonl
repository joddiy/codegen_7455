Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n    # Merge the two sorted arrays\n    merged = sorted(arr1 + arr2)\n    # Return the kth element\n    return merged[k - 1]\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6\n```\n\nThis script first merges the two input arrays into one sorted array.
