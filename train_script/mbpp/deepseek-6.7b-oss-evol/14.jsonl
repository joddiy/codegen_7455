A Woodall number is a number that is a perfect square and its digits are in increasing order.\n\nThe function works by first converting the number to a string, sorting the string, and then converting the sorted string back to an integer.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_woodall(n):\n    # Convert the number to a string and sort it\n    sorted_n = sorted(str(n))\n    # Convert the sorted string back to an integer\n    sorted_n = int(''.join(sorted_n))\n    # Check if the number is a perfect square\n    return n == sorted_n ** 2\n\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\nIn this Python script, the function `is_woodall` checks if a given number `n` is a Woodall number.
