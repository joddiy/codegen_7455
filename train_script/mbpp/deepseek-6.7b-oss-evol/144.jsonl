Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cylinder(radius, height):\n    return math.pi * radius**2 * height\n\nassert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThe function `volume_cylinder` calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `V = \u03c0r\u00b2h`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height of the cylinder.
