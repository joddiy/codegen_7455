Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        sum += i*i*i*2\n    return sum\n\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `cube_Sum(n)` that calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.
