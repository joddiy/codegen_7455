Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef index_multiplication(tuples):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(tuples[0])):\n        temp = []\n        for j in range(len(tuples)):\n            temp.append(tuples[j][i])\n        result.append(tuple(temp))\n    return result\n\nassert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))\n```\n\nThe function `index_multiplication` takes a tuple of tuples as input.
