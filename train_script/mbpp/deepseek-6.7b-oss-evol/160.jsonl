Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to return the sum of all divisors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_div(8)==7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_div(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n\nassert sum_div(8)==7\n```\n\nThe function `sum_div(n)` calculates all divisors of a number `n` by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by the current number.
