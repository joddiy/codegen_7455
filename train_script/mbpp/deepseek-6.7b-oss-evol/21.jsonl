Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuples):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for i in range(len(tuples)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(tuples)):\n            diff = abs(tuples[i][0] - tuples[j][0]) + abs(tuples[i][1] - tuples[j][1])\n            if diff > max_diff:\n                max_diff = diff\n    return max_diff\n\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `max_difference` that takes a list of tuples as input.
