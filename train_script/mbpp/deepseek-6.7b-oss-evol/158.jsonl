Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the third side of a right angled triangle. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert otherside_rightangle(7,8)==10.63014581273465\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef otherside_rightangle(a, b):\n    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n\nassert otherside_rightangle(7,8)==10.63014581273465\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `otherside_rightangle` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
