Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return \"Input should be a positive integer.\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        seq = [0, 1, 1]\n        for i in range(3, n+1):\n            seq.append(seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]])\n        return seq[n]\n\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\nThe function `sequence(n)` calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence.
