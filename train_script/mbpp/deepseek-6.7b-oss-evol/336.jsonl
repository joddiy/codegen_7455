We then initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the list, respectively. We then enter a while loop that continues until `left` is less than `right`. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the midpoint of the current search range and check if the value at the midpoint is less than the input value. If it is, we update `left` to be one more than the midpoint. If it's not, we update `right` to be the midpoint. Once the loop finishes, `left` will be the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. We then return `left`.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function is working as expected. If the function is correct, it will pass the assertion without any output.
