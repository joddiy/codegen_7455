Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to remove odd numbers from a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_odd(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst if i % 2 == 0]\n\nassert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]\n```\n\nThe function `remove_odd` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list and only includes the elements that are divisible by 2 (i.e., the even numbers).
