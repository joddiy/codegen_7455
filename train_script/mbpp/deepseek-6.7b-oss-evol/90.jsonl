Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    return max(arr) - min(arr)\n\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\nThe function `max_Abs_Diff` takes an array as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.
