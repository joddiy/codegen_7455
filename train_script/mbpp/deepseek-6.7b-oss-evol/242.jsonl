Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert big_sum([1,2,3]) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef big_sum(arr):\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return \"Array should have at least two elements\"\n    else:\n        return min(arr) + max(arr)\n\n# Test the function\nassert big_sum([1,2,3]) == 4\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first check if the array has at least two elements.
