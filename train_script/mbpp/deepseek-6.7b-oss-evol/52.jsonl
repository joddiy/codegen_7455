Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef multiply_num(num_list):\n    product = 1\n    for num in num_list:\n        product *= num\n    return product / len(num_list)\n\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThe function `multiply_num` takes a list of numbers as input, multiplies all the numbers in the list together, and then divides the result by the length of the list.
