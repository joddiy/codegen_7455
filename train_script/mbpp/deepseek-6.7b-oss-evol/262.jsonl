Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]) ==  720000000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef unique_product(lst):\n    unique_nums = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_nums:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n\nassert unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]) == 720000000\n```\n\nThe function `unique_product` first converts the list to a set to remove duplicate values.
