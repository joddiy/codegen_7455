The output should be a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dic):\n    return tup + (dic,)\n\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})\n```\n\nIn the function `add_dict_to_tuple`, we are adding the dictionary `dic` to the tuple `tup`.
