It uses the built-in `count` method of list to count the number of occurrences of the given number in the list. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the expected result for the given input. If the function returns the expected result, the `assert` statement does nothing. If the function does not return the expected result, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    return lst.count(num)\n\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\nThe function `frequency` takes a list and a number as input.
