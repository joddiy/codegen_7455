It checks if the element is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the element is odd, it is included in the new list. The function then returns this new list. The `assert` statement checks if the function works as expected. If the function returns the expected result, the `assert` statement does nothing. If the function does not return the expected result, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Split(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]\n\nassert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]\n```\n\nThe function `Split` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the list.
