It then iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` in the range from 0 to `n`. If it finds a pair `(x, y)` that satisfies the equation `ax + by = n`, it returns this pair as a tuple. If no such pair is found after checking all possible combinations, it returns `None`. The assertion at the end verifies that the function works correctly for the given example.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_solution(a, b, n):\n    for x in range(n+1):\n        for y in range(n+1):\n            if a*x + b*y == n:\n                return (x, y)\n    return None\n\nassert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `find_solution` that takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `n` as input.
