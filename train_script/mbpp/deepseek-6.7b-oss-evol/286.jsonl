Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find sum and average of first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_average(n):\n    sum_num = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    avg_num = sum_num / n\n    return sum_num, avg_num\n\nassert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)\n```\n\nThe function `sum_average` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
