Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert list_to_float( [(\"3\", \"4\"), (\"1\", \"26.45\"), (\"7.32\", \"8\"), (\"4\", \"8\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef list_to_float(lst):\n    return [tuple(map(float, sublist)) for sublist in lst]\n\nassert list_to_float( [(\"3\", \"4\"), (\"1\", \"26.45\"), (\"7.32\", \"8\"), (\"4\", \"8\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]\n```\n\nThe function `list_to_float` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list.
