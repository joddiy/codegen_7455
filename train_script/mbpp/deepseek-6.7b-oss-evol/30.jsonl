It does this by iterating through all possible values of `i` and `j` (where `i` and `j` are non-negative integers), and checking if `i*i + j*j` equals `n`. If it does, the function returns `True`. If no such pair of `i` and `j` is found, the function returns `False`.\n\nThe assertion `assert dif_Square(5) == True` checks whether the function works correctly for the number 5. If the function is correct, this assertion should pass without any error.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    i = 0\n    while i * i <= n:\n        j = 0\n        while j * j <= n:\n            if i * i + j * j == n:\n                return True\n            j += 1\n        i += 1\n    return False\n\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\nThis Python function `dif_Square(n)` checks whether a given number `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares.
