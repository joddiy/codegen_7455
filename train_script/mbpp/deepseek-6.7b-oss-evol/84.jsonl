Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            n -= 1\n        else:\n            n /= 2\n    return n == 0\n\nassert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True\n```\n\nThe function `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two` checks if a given number `n` can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2.
