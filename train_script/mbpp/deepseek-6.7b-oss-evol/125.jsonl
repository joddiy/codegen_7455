The assertion checks if the function works correctly.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_integer(lst):\n    return sum(1 for i in lst if isinstance(i, int))\n\nassert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2\n```\n\nThe function `count_integer` uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and check if each element is an instance of the `int` class.
