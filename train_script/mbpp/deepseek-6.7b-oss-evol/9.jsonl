{"task_id": "Mbpp/14", "completion": "\n    Here is a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    # Calculate the volume\n    volume = base_area * length\n    return volume\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Volume(10, 8, 6) == 240\n```\n\nThis function takes three parameters: the base of the triangular prism, the height of the triangular prism, and the length of the prism. It calculates the area of the base using the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 * base * height), then multiplies this by the length to find the volume. The function then returns this volume. The assert statement at the end is used to test the function with the given parameters and expected result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism:\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    # Calculate the volume\n    volume = base_area * length\n    return volume\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Volume(10, 8, 6) == 240\n```\n\nThis function takes three parameters: the base of the triangular prism, the height of the triangular prism, and the length of the prism.
