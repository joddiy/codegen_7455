It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and then iterates over each number in the list, multiplying the current `product` by the current number. After the loop, it checks if the `product` is even by checking if the remainder when `product` is divided by 2 is 0. If the `product` is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe assertion at the end checks if the function works correctly for the given input. If the function returns `True` when given the list `[1,2,3]`, the assertion will pass.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_product_even(lst):\n    product = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        product *= num\n    return product % 2 == 0\n\nassert is_product_even([1,2,3]) == True\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `is_product_even` that takes a list of numbers as input.
