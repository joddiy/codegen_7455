Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of lists in a given number of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_list(lst):\n    return len(lst)\n\nassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4\n```\n\nThe function `count_list` takes a list of lists as input and returns the number of lists in the input list.
