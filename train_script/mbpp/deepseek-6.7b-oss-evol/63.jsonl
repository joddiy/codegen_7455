Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    return list(set.intersection(*map(set, nested_lists)))\n\nassert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])\n```\n\nThe function `common_in_nested_lists` takes a list of lists as input.
