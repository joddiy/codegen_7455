If `n` is 0, it returns 1 because 2^0 = 1. If `n` is not 0, it calculates the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` using the bitwise operation `bit_length()`. This operation returns the number of bits required to represent a number in binary, which is equivalent to the power of 2.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()\n\nassert next_power_of_2(0) == 1\n```\n\nThe function `next_power_of_2(n)` calculates the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.
