It first initializes a 2D list `dp` to store the number of sequences for each value of `m` and `n`. Then it fills in the `dp` list by iterating over each possible value of `last` and `length`, and for each `last`, it sums the number of sequences of length `length-1` ending in all values less than `last`. Finally, it sums up the number of sequences of length `n` ending in all values from 1 to `m` to get the total number of sequences.
