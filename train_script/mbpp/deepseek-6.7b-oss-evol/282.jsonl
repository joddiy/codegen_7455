Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_Swaps(s1, s2):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s1)):\n        if s1[i] != s2[i]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert min_Swaps(\"1101\",\"1110\") == 1\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each character in the two strings.
