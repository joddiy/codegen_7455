Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef common_element(list1, list2):\n    for i in list1:\n        if i in list2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])==True\n```\n\nThe function `common_element` takes two lists as input.
