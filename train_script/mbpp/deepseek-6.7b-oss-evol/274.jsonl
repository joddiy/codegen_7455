Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert a list to a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert list_tuple([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3])==(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef list_tuple(lst):\n    return tuple(lst)\n\nassert list_tuple([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3])==(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)\n```\n\nThe function `list_tuple` takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple created from that list.
