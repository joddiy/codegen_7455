It uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements of the tuple into a single string, with the delimiter in between each element. The `str` function is used to convert each element to a string before joining, to ensure that all elements can be joined.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to concatenate each element of tuple by the delimiter. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert concatenate_tuple((\"ID\", \"is\", 4, \"UTS\") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef concatenate_tuple(tup, delimiter='-'):\n    return delimiter.join(str(x) for x in tup)\n\nassert concatenate_tuple((\"ID\", \"is\", 4, \"UTS\")) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'\n```\n\nThe function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple and a delimiter as input.
