Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_undulating(1212121) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_undulating(n):\n    n = str(n)\n    if len(n) < 3:\n        return False\n    else:\n        for i in range(len(n)-2):\n            if n[i] == n[i+1] == n[i+2]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\nassert is_undulating(1212121) == True\n```\n\nThe function `is_undulating` converts the input number to a string, then checks if the length of the string is less than 3.
