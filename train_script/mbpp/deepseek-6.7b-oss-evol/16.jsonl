Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_Max_Num(lst):\n    lst.sort(reverse=True)\n    return int(\"\".join(map(str, lst)))\n\nassert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321\n```\n\nThe function `find_Max_Num` sorts the list in descending order and then joins the elements of the list into a string.
