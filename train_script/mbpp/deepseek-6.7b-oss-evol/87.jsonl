Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef pancake_sort(lst):\n    for i in range(len(lst), 0, -1):\n        max_index = lst.index(max(lst[0:i]))\n        if max_index != i - 1:\n            if max_index != 0:\n                lst = lst[max_index::-1] + lst[max_index + 1:]\n            lst = lst[i - 1::-1] + lst[i:]\n    return lst\n\nassert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]\n```\n\nThis script uses the Pancake Sort algorithm, which is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
