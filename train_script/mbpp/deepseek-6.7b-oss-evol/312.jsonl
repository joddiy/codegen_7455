Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to move all zeroes to the end of the given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    # Filter out the zeroes\n    zeroes = [num for num in lst if num == 0]\n    # Filter out the non-zeroes\n    non_zeroes = [num for num in lst if num != 0]\n    # Combine the non-zeroes and zeroes\n    return non_zeroes + zeroes\n\n# Test the function\nassert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]\n```\n\nThis function works by first filtering out the zeroes and the non-zeroes from the list.
