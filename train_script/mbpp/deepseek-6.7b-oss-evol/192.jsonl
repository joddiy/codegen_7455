The `assert` statement checks if the function is working as expected.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether any value in a sequence exists in a sequence or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    for value in seq1:\n        if value in seq2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\nThis Python function `overlapping` checks if any value in the first sequence (`seq1`) exists in the second sequence (`seq2`).
