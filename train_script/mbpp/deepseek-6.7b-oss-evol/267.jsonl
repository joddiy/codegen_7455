Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert tuples to sets to remove duplicates and find dissimilar elements\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n\n    # Find dissimilar elements\n    dissimilar = set1 ^ set2\n\n    # Convert back to tuple and return\n    return tuple(dissimilar)\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `find_dissimilar` that takes two tuples as input.
