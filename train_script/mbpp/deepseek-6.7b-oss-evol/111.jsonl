The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length. The `assert` statement checks if the function `volume_cube` returns the correct volume for a cube with a side length of 3. If the function returns a different value, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert volume_cube(3)==27\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length):\n    return side_length ** 3\n\nassert volume_cube(3) == 27\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `volume_cube` that takes the side length of a cube as an argument and returns its volume.
