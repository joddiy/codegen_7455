Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of fourth power of first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_num_sum(2) == 82\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):\n        sum += i**4\n    return sum\n\nassert odd_num_sum(2) == 82\n```\n\nThe function `odd_num_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers.
