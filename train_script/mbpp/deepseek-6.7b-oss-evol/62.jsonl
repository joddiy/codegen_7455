Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\n    # Calculate the number of odd values in the original binary string\n    original_odd_count = binary_string.count('1')\n\n    # Calculate the number of odd values in the rotated binary strings\n    rotated_odd_count = 0\n    for _ in range(rotations):\n        binary_string = binary_string[-1] + binary_string[:-1]  # Rotate the binary string\n        rotated_odd_count += binary_string.count('1')\n\n    # Calculate the number of binary strings with an odd value\n    odd_count = original_odd_count + rotated_odd_count\n\n    return odd_count\n\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\nThis script works by first counting the number of '1's in the original binary string.
