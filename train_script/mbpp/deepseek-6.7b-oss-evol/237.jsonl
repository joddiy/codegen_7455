It initializes a variable `product` to 1. Then it iterates over each number in the array. For each number, it multiplies the current `product` by the number and takes the modulo of `n`. The result is then assigned back to `product`. Finally, it returns the `product`.\n\nThe assertion checks if the function works correctly for the given input.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the product of the array multiplication modulo n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        product = (product * num) % n\n    return product\n\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) == 9\n```\n\nThe function `find_remainder` takes an array of numbers and a number `n` as input.
