Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_monthnumb_number(5)==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month_number):\n    # List of months with 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]\n    \n    # Check if the month number is in the list of months with 31 days\n    if month_number in months_with_31_days:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert check_monthnumb_number(5)==True\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes a month number as input and checks if it is in a list of months that have 31 days.
