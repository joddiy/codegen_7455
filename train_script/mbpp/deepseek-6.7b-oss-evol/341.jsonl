Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a Python script that calculates the area of a tetrahedron:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef area_tetrahedron(edge_length):\n    # The formula to calculate the area of a tetrahedron is:\n    # Area = sqrt(3) * edge_length^2\n    return math.sqrt(3) * math.pow(edge_length, 2)\n\n# Test the function\nassert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894\n```\n\nThis script uses the formula `sqrt(3) * edge_length^2` to calculate the area of a tetrahedron.
