Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find minimum of three numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return min(a, b, c)\n\nassert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0\n```\n\nThe function `min_of_three` takes three arguments and returns the minimum of the three numbers using the built-in `min` function in Python.
