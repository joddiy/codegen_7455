Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether a list of numbers contains only one distinct element or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert unique_Element([1,1,1]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef unique_Element(lst):\n    return len(set(lst)) == 1\n\nassert unique_Element([1,1,1]) == True\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the list to a set, which removes any duplicate elements.
