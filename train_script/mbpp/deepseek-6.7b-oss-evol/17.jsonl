Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(x, y):\n    return (x ^ y) < 0\n\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\n```\n\nIn this function, the XOR operator (^) is used to check if the signs of the two numbers are different.
