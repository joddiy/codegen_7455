Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Average_Of_Cube(2) == 4.5\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n    sum_of_cubes = sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n+1))\n    average = sum_of_cubes / n\n    return average\n\nassert find_Average_Of_Cube(2) == 4.5\n```\n\nThe function `find_Average_Of_Cube(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using a generator expression and the `sum()` function.
