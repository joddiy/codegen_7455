It converts the array to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, and then checks if the length of the original array and the set are equal. If they are equal, it means that there were no duplicates in the array, so it returns `False`.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert test_duplicate(([1,2,3,4,5]))==False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))\n\nassert test_duplicate([1,2,3,4,5])==False\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `test_duplicate` that takes an array of integers as input.
