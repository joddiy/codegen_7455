Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(s1, s2):\n    return ''.join([char for char in s1 if char not in s2])\n\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\nThe function `remove_dirty_chars` takes two strings as input.
