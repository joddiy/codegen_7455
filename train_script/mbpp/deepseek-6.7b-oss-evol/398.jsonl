It iterates over each element in the first tuple and checks if it is smaller than the corresponding element in the second tuple. If it finds an element in the first tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the second tuple, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements without finding any that are not smaller, it returns `True`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_smaller(t1, t2):\n    for i in range(len(t1)):\n        if t1[i] >= t2[i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\nThe function `check_smaller` takes two tuples as arguments.
