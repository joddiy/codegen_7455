This creates a new string that contains all possible rotations of the original string. Then, it finds the smallest rotation by comparing all substrings of the new string. The index of the smallest rotation in the new string is the number of rotations required to get the same string.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s):\n    # Concatenate the string with itself\n    s += s\n    # Find the length of the original string\n    n = len(s) // 2\n    # Find the length of the smallest rotation\n    min_rotation = min(s[i:i+n] for i in range(n))\n    # Return the number of rotations\n    return s.index(min_rotation)\n\n# Test the function\nassert find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n```\n\nThe function `find_Rotations` works by concatenating the input string with itself.
