Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef division_elements(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a / b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n\nassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThe function `division_elements` takes two tuples as input, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the division of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.
