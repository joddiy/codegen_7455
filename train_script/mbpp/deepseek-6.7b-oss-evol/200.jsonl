Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(lst, element):\n    count = 0\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if element in sublist:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3\n```\n\nThe function `count_element_in_list` iterates over each sublist in the given list.
