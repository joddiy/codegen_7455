Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find(num1, num2):\n    return num1 // num2\n\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\nThis Python function uses the floor division operator (//) to find the quotient of two numbers.
