Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_two_three(text):\n    pattern = r'ab{2,3}'\n    if re.search(pattern, text):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Testing the function\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ab\")==(False)\nassert text_match_two_three(\"abb\")==(True)\nassert text_match_two_three(\"abbb\")==(True)\n```\n\nThe function `text_match_two_three` uses the `re` module to search for the pattern 'ab{2,3}' in the input string.
