Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])\n\nassert split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])\n```\n\nThe function `split_two_parts` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
