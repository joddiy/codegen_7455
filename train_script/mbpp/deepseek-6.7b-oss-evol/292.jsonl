Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert degrees to radians. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert radian_degree(90)==1.5707963267948966\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef degree_to_radian(degree):\n    return degree * math.pi / 180\n\nassert degree_to_radian(90) == 1.5707963267948966\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `degree_to_radian` that takes a degree value as input and returns the equivalent radian value.
