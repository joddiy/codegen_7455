Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if n % i == 0 and i % 2 == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\n```\n\nThis Python function uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
