The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is 4 * side_length ^ 2. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the correct value for a cube with a side length of 5.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    return 4 * side_length ** 2\n\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100\n```\n\nIn the above code, the function `lateralsurface_cube` takes the side length of the cube as an argument and returns the lateral surface area of the cube.
