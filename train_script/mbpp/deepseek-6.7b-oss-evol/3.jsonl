It calculates the XOR of the two numbers, which gives a number with a 1 in each bit position where the corresponding bits in the input numbers differ. The function then counts the number of set bits in this XOR result (i.e., the number of positions where the numbers differ) and returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, and `False` otherwise. The script then tests this function with the provided assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    # XOR operation to find the difference\n    xor_result = num1 ^ num2\n    # Count the number of set bits in the XOR result\n    count = bin(xor_result).count(\"1\")\n    # If count is 1, then the numbers differ at one bit position only\n    return count == 1\n\n# Test the function\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` that takes two numbers as input.
