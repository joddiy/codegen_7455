Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]])==[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sort_matrix(matrix):\n    return sorted(matrix, key=sum)\n\nassert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]])==[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `sort_matrix` that takes a matrix as input and returns a sorted version of the matrix, sorted by the sum of its rows.
