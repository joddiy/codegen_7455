Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef and_tuples(t1, t2):\n    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n\nassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples as arguments.
