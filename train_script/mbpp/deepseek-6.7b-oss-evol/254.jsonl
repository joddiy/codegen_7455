Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract values between quotation marks from a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_values('\"Python\", \"PHP\", \"Java\"')==['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_values(string):\n    return re.findall(r'\"([^\"]*)\"', string)\n\nassert extract_values('\"Python\", \"PHP\", \"Java\"')==['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']\n```\n\nIn this script, we use the `re` module in Python which provides support for regular expressions.
