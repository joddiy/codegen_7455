The expression `n & 1` gives the least significant bit of `n`, and if that bit is 1, it increments the count. The expression `n >>= 1` shifts `n` one bit to the right, effectively discarding the least significant bit. This process continues until `n` is 0, at which point the function returns the count.\n\nThe assertion `assert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1` checks that the function is working correctly. If the function is implemented correctly, this assertion should pass without any output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n:\n        count += n & 1\n        n >>= 1\n    return count\n\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\nThe function `count_Set_Bits` works by using a while loop to iterate over each bit in the binary representation of the input number `n`.
