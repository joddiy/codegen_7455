Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(lst):\n    even = next((x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0), None)\n    odd = next((x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0), None)\n    return even - odd if even and odd else None\n\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `diff_even_odd` that takes a list of numbers as input.
