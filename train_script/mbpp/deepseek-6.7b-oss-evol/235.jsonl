The maximum product of the entire array is then the maximum of all maximum products.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    max_prod = [0]*n\n    max_prod[0] = arr[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        max_prod[i] = max(max_prod[i-1]*arr[i], arr[i])\n    return max(max_prod)\n\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\nThe function `max_product` calculates the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in the array.
