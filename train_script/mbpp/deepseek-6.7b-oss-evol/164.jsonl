{"task_id": "Mbpp/300", "completion": "\n    This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] will store the count of binary sequences of length 2i such that the sum of first i bits is equal to the sum of last i bits.\n\n    The base case is when i=0, there is only one sequence 0 and the count is 1.\n\n    For each i and j, we can either append a 0 or a 1 to the sequence. If we append a 0, the sum of first i bits remains the same as the sum of last i bits. If we append a 1, the sum of first i bits increases by 1 and the sum of last i bits also increases by 1.\n\n    The final answer will be dp[n][n].\n\n    Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            if j > 0:\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n            if j < i:\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j]\n\n    return dp[2 * n][n]\n\nassert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis code first initializes the dp array with base cases, then iterates over all possible values of i and j to fill in the dp array.
