Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a sphere. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_sphere(radius):\n    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius**3)\n\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `volume_sphere` that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius.
