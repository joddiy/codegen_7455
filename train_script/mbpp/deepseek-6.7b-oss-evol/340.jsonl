Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(string):\n    return len(set(string)) <= 1\n\nassert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False\n```\n\nIn this function, we convert the string to a set, which removes any duplicate characters.
