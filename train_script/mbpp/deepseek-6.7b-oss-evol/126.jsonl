Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in a list and length n, and generates all combinations (with repetition) of the elements of the list and returns a list with a tuple for each combination. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert combinations_colors( [\"Red\",\"Green\",\"Blue\"],1)==[('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef combinations_colors(lst, n):\n    return list(product(lst, repeat=n))\n\nassert combinations_colors([\"Red\",\"Green\",\"Blue\"],1)==[('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]\n```\n\nThe function `combinations_colors` uses the `product` function from the `itertools` module to generate all combinations of the elements of the list `lst` with length `n`.
