Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")==('216.8.94.196')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip):\n    ip_parts = ip.split('.')\n    new_ip_parts = [str(int(part)) for part in ip_parts]\n    return '.'.join(new_ip_parts)\n\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")==('216.8.94.196')\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `removezero_ip` that takes an IP address as a string, splits it into its four parts, converts each part to an integer, removes leading zeroes, and then joins the parts back together with periods.
