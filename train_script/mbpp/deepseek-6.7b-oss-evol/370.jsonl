Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    return sum(set(lst))\n\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\nThe function `find_sum` takes a list as an argument.
