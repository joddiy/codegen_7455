Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove uppercase substrings from a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_uppercase('cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs') == 'cstyoravoitshos'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_uppercase(s):\n    return ''.join([c for c in s if not c.isupper()])\n\nassert remove_uppercase('cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs') == 'cstyoravoitshos'\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `remove_uppercase` that takes a string `s` as input.
