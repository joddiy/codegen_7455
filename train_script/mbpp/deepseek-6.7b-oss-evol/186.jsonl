{"task_id": "Mbpp/406", "completion": "\n```python\ndef find_Parity(num):\n    return num % 2 != 0\n\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\nThe function `find_Parity` takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the parity of the number is odd and `False` if it is even. The parity of a number is determined by the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, the parity is odd, and if it is 0, the parity is even. The `assert` statement checks if the function `find_Parity` returns `False` for the input `12`, which is expected as `12` is an even number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_Parity(num):\n    return num % 2 != 0\n\nassert find_Parity(12) == False\n```\n\nThe function `find_Parity` takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the parity of the number is odd and `False` if it is even.
