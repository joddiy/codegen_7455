Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check(n):\n    # Convert the number to string to reverse it\n    str_n = str(n)\n    # Reverse the string\n    reversed_str_n = str_n[::-1]\n    # Convert the reversed string back to integer\n    reversed_n = int(reversed_str_n)\n    # Check if the number is one less than twice its reverse\n    return n == (reversed_n * 2) - 1\n\n# Test the function\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `check(n)` that checks if a given number `n` is one less than twice its reverse.
