Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_length(s, k):\n    words = s.split()\n    words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]\n    return ' '.join(words)\n\nassert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'\n```\n\nThe function `remove_length` splits the input string into a list of words, then uses a list comprehension to filter out any words that have a length equal to `k`.
