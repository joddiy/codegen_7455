The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character, and the `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of ASCII values. Finally, the result is converted back to a character using the `chr` function, and the character is returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_Char(s):\n    return chr(sum(ord(c) for c in s) % 26 + ord('a'))\n```\nThe `get_Char` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
