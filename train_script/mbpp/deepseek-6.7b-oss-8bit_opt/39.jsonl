Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the surface area of a sphere. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(surfacearea_sphere(10), 1256.6370614359173, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef surfacearea_sphere(radius):\n    return 4 * math.pi * radius ** 2\n\n# Test the function\nassert math.isclose(surfacearea_sphere(10), 1256.6370614359173, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThe `surfacearea_sphere` function calculates the surface area of a sphere using the formula `4 * pi * r^2`, where `r` is the radius of the sphere.
