Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\n    sum_of_even_index_coeff = 0\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            sum_of_even_index_coeff += binomial_coefficient(n, i)\n    return sum_of_even_index_coeff\n\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return binomial_coefficient(n - 1, k - 1) + binomial_coefficient(n - 1, k)\n```\n\nThe `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` function iterates through the even index binomial coefficients and calculates their sum.
