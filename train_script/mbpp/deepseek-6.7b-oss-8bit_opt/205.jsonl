{"task_id": "Mbpp/430", "completion": "\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a, b, c):\n    return -4*a*c\n```\nThe function `parabola_directrix` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the coefficients of the parabola equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. It returns the directrix of the parabola, which is the value of `x` where the parabola intersects the `x`-axis. In this case, the directrix is calculated as `-4*a*c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coefficients of the parabola equation.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert parabola_directrix(5,3,2)==-198\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a, b, c):\n    return -4*a*c\n```\nThe function `parabola_directrix` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the coefficients of the parabola equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.
