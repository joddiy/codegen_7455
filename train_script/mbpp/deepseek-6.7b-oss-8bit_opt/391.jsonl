Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n    if a == b == c:\n        return 3\n    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\nThe `test_three_equal` function takes three integers as input and checks if all three are equal, if two are equal, or if none are equal.
