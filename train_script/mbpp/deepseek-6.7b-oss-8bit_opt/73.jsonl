Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_length(\"11000010001\") == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string):\n    max_diff = 0\n    count_0 = 0\n    count_1 = 0\n    for char in binary_string:\n        if char == '0':\n            count_0 += 1\n        else:\n            count_1 += 1\n        diff = count_1 - count_0\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n    return max_diff\n```"}
