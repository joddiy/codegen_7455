Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_woodall(383) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_woodall(n):\n    # Convert the number to a string and check if it is a palindrome\n    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]\n```\nThe `is_woodall` function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it is a palindrome by converting it to a string and then checking if the string is equal to its reverse.
