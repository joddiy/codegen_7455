Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to interchange the first and last elements in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        return lst\n    else:\n        lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]\n        return lst\n```\nThe `swap_List` function takes a list as input and checks if its length is less than 2.
