Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Diff(li1, li2):\n    return list(set(li1) - set(li2))\n```\nThe `Diff` function takes two lists `li1` and `li2` as input and returns the difference between the two lists.
