Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\n    if month_number in [4, 6, 9, 11]:\n        return True\n    elif month_number == 2:\n        return False  # February has 28 or 29 days\n    else:\n        return False\n```\nThe `check_monthnumber_number` function takes a month number as input and returns `True` if the month contains 30 days, and `False` otherwise.
