Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef newman_conway(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Input must be a positive integer greater than 0\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return \"1\"\n    else:\n        sequence = [0, 1, 1]\n        for i in range(3, n + 1):\n            sequence.append(sequence[sequence[i - 1]] + sequence[i - sequence[i - 1]])\n        return sequence[n]\n```\nThe `newman_conway` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence.
