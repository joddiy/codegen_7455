It then uses a generator expression to extract the n'th element from each row of the matrix and returns the maximum value. This solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\n    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)\n```\nThe `max_of_nth` function takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input.
