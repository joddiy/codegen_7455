It then uses Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the list within the specified range. The `start:end+1` syntax is used to slice the list to include the elements from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. The resulting sum is then returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_range_list(lst, start, end):\n    return sum(lst[start:end+1])\n```\nThe `sum_range_list` function takes a list `lst`, a starting index `start`, and an ending index `end` as input.
