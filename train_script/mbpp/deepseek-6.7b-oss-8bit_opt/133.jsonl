If the human age is greater than 2, the function returns 21 plus the product of the difference between the human age and 2 and 4.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to calculate a dog's age in dog's years. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dog_age(12)==61\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_age):\n    if human_age <= 2:\n        return human_age * 10.5\n    else:\n        return 21 + (human_age - 2) * 4\n```\nThe `dog_age` function takes the human age as input and returns the corresponding dog age in dog's years.
