It initializes `left` and `right` to 0 and the length of the array, respectively. It then enters a while loop where it calculates the midpoint and compares the value at the midpoint with the given value. If the value at the midpoint is less than the given value, it updates `left` to be the midpoint plus 1. If the value at the midpoint is greater than or equal to the given value, it updates `right` to be the midpoint. This process continues until the left and right pointers meet, at which point the left pointer represents the left insertion point for the given value. The function then returns the left pointer as the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/data-structures-and-algorithms/python-data-structure-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, value):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\nThe `left_insertion` function takes a sorted array `arr` and a value `value` as input.
