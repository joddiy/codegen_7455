Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check(num):\n    def reverse_number(n):\n        return int(str(n)[::-1])\n\n    return num == reverse_number(num) * 2 - 1\n\n# Test the function\nassert check(70) == False\n```\nThe `check` function first defines a helper function `reverse_number` to reverse a given number.
