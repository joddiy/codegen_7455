Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_dirty_chars(\"probasscurve\", \"pros\") == 'bacuve'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\n    clean_str = \"\"\n    for char in str1:\n        if char not in str2:\n            clean_str += char\n    return clean_str\n```\n\nThe `remove_dirty_chars` function iterates through each character in the first string and checks if it is present in the second string.
