It initializes `min_len` to infinity and `min_sublist` to an empty list. Then, it iterates through the input list, updating `min_len` and `min_sublist` whenever a shorter sublist is found. Finally, it returns the sublist with the minimum length.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Min(lst):\n    min_len = float('inf')\n    min_sublist = []\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if len(sublist) < min_len:\n            min_len = len(sublist)\n            min_sublist = sublist\n    return min_sublist\n```\nThe `Find_Min` function iterates through the input list of sublists and finds the sublist with the minimum length.
