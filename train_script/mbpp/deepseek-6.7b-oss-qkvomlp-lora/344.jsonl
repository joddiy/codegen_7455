If the condition is met, the number is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find numbers within a given range from startnum ti endnum where every number is divisible by every digit it contains. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/lambda/python-lambda-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n    result = []\n    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):\n        if all(num % int(digit) == 0 for digit in str(num)):\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n\nassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]\n```\n\nThe `divisible_by_digits` function takes two arguments, `startnum` and `endnum`, and returns a list of numbers within the given range where every number is divisible by every digit it contains.
