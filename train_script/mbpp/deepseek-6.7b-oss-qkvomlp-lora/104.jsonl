Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def count_Set_Bits(num):\n        count = 0\n        while num:\n            num &= num - 1\n            count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n    The `count_Set_Bits` function uses a bitwise AND operation to count the number of set bits in the given number.
