Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef extract_rear(tuple_of_strings):\n    return [string[-1] for string in tuple_of_strings]\n```\nThe `extract_rear` function takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the rear index element of each string in the tuple.
