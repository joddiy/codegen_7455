Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_words(\"python program\")==(\"program python\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def reverse_words(input_string):\n        words = input_string.split()\n        reversed_words = words[::-1]\n        return \" \".join(reversed_words)\n    ```\n    The `reverse_words` function splits the input string into words using the `split` method, reverses the list of words using slicing, and then joins the reversed words back into a string with spaces using the `join` method.
