Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of fourth power of first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_num_sum(2) == 82\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def odd_num_sum(n):\n        return sum(i ** 4 for i in range(1, 2 * n, 2))\n    ```\n    The `odd_num_sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers.
