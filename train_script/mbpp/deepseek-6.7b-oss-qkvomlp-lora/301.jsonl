Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to divide two lists element wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list2[i] != 0:\n            result.append(list1[i] / list2[i])\n        else:\n            result.append(float('inf'))  # Handle division by zero\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `div_list` function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the element-wise division of the elements in the input lists.
