Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def sum_Of_product(n):\n        result = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            product = 1\n            for j in range(1, i+1):\n                product *= j\n            result += product\n        return result\n    ```\n    The `sum_Of_product` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients up to `n`.
