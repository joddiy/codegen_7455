The function then returns the maximum absolute difference found.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    arr = sorted(arr)\n    max_diff = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i+1])\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n    return max_diff\n```\nThe `max_Abs_Diff` function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.
