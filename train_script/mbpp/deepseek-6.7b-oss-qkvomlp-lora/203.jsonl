Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def shell_sort(arr):\n        n = len(arr)\n        gap = n // 2\n        while gap > 0:\n            for i in range(gap, n):\n                temp = arr[i]\n                j = i\n                while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                    arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                    j -= gap\n                arr[j] = temp\n            gap //= 2\n        return arr\n    ```\n    The `shell_sort` function takes an array `arr` as input and sorts it using the shell sort algorithm.
