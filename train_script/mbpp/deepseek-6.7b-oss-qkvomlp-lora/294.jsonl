Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find nth bell number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert bell_Number(2) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def bell_Number(n):\n        bell = [1]\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            new_bell = [1]\n            for j in range(1, i+1):\n                new_bell.append(new_bell[j-1] + bell[j-1])\n            bell = new_bell\n        return bell[n]\n    ```\n    The `bell_Number` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth bell number using a dynamic programming approach.
