Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def add_pairwise(t):\n        return tuple(t[i] + t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1))\n    ```\n    The `add_pairwise` function takes a tuple `t` as input and returns a tuple containing the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of the input tuple.
