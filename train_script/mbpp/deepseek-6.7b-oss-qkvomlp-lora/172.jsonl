Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a cone. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cone(radius, height):\n    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height\n    return volume\n\n# Test the function\nassert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThe `volume_cone` function takes the radius and height of a cone as input and calculates its volume using the formula for the volume of a cone.
