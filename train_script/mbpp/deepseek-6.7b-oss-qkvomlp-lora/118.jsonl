Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the next perfect square greater than a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    def next_Perfect_Square(num):\n        next_square = math.ceil(math.sqrt(num)) ** 2\n        return next_square\n\n    # Test the function\n    assert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36\n    ```\n\n    The `next_Perfect_Square` function takes a number as input and returns the next perfect square greater than the given number.
