It iterates through the list and uses the `count` method of the tuple to count the occurrences of each element in the tuple. The total count is returned as the output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tuple_input, list_input):\n    count = 0\n    for element in list_input:\n        count += tuple_input.count(element)\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_Occurrence` function takes a tuple and a list as input and returns the count of occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple.
