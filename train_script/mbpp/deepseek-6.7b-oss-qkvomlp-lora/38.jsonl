Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def newman_conway(n):\n        if n <= 0:\n            return \"Invalid input: n must be a positive integer\"\n        elif n == 1:\n            return \"1\"\n        else:\n            sequence = [1, 1]\n            for i in range(2, n):\n                sequence.append(sequence[sequence[i-1]-1] + sequence[i-sequence[i-1]-1])\n            return \" \".join(map(str, sequence))\n    ```\n    The `newman_conway` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
