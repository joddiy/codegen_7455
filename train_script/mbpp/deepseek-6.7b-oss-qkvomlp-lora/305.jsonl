It then uses a list comprehension to compute the n-th power of each number in the input list and returns the result. The assertion provided in the problem description is used to test the correctness of the `nth_nums` function.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to compute the n-th power of each number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert nth_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],2)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef nth_nums(nums, n):\n    return [num ** n for num in nums]\n```\n\nThe `nth_nums` function takes a list of numbers `nums` and an integer `n` as input.
