Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def min_product_tuple(tuples):\n        min_product = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(tuples)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(tuples)):\n                product = tuples[i][0] * tuples[j][1]\n                if product < min_product:\n                    min_product = product\n        return min_product\n    ```\n\n    The `min_product_tuple` function iterates through all pairs of tuples within the given list and calculates the product of each pair.
