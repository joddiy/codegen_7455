It does this by using the bitwise OR operation with the binary number `0b10101010101010101010101010101010`, which has all even bits set. This ensures that all even bits of the input number are set to 1.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def even_bit_set_number(n):\n        return n | 0b10101010101010101010101010101010\n    ```\n    The `even_bit_set_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number with all even bits set.
