It splits the string into a list of words and then filters out words that are shorter than `n` characters. The filtered list of words is returned as the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert long_words(3,\"python is a programming language\")==['python','programming','language']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef long_words(n, words):\n    return [word for word in words.split() if len(word) > n]\n```\nThe `long_words` function takes two arguments: `n`, which is the minimum length of words to be included in the result, and `words`, which is a string containing the list of words.
