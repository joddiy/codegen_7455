Finally, it returns the sum of the list, which represents the count of prime numbers less than n.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    primes = [True] * (n + 1)\n    primes[0] = primes[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if primes[i]:\n            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):\n                primes[j] = False\n    return sum(primes)\n```\nThe `count_Primes_nums` function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to count the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
