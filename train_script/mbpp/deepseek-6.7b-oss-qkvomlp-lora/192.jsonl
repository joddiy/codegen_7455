Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether any value in a sequence exists in a sequence or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n        for item in seq1:\n            if item in seq2:\n                return True\n        return False\n    ```\n    The `overlapping` function iterates through the elements of `seq1` and checks if any element exists in `seq2`.
