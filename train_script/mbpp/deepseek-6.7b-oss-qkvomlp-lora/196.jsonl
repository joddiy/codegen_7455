Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cube_Sum(2) == 72\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def cube_Sum(n):\n        sum = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            sum += i**3\n        return sum\n    ```\n    The `cube_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.
