Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_Char(\"abc\") == \"f\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def get_Char(string):\n        total = sum(ord(char) for char in string)\n        return chr((total % 26) + ord('a'))\n    ```\n    The `get_Char` function takes a string as input and calculates the sum of the ASCII values of its characters.
