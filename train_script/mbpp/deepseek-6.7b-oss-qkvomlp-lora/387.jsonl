Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def sum_in_range(l, r):\n        return sum(range(l, r+1, 2))\n    ```\n    The `sum_in_range` function takes two arguments `l` and `r`, representing the lower and upper bounds of the range.
