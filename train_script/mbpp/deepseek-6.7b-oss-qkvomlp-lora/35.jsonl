Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth tetrahedral number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def tetrahedral_number(n):\n        return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6\n    ```\n    The `tetrahedral_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth tetrahedral number.
