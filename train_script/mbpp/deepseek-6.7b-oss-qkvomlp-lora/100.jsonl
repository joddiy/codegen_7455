Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n        return 5 * side_length\n    ```\n    The `perimeter_pentagon` function takes the length of the side of a regular pentagon as input and returns the perimeter of the pentagon.
