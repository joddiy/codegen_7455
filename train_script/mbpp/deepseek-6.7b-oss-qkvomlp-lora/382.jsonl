Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove tuples from the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_nested(tup):\n    result = []\n    for item in tup:\n        if isinstance(item, tuple):\n            result.extend(remove_nested(item))\n        else:\n            result.append(item)\n    return tuple(result)\n```\nThe `remove_nested` function takes a tuple as input and iterates through its elements.
