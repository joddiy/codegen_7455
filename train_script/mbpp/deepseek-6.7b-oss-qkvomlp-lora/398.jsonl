Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n        for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n            if tuple1[i] >= tuple2[i]:\n                return False\n        return True\n    ```\n    The `check_smaller` function takes two tuples as input and iterates through each element of the second tuple.

If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function returns True."}
