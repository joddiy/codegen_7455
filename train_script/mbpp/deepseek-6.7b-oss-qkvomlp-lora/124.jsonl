Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert convert(1) == (1.0, 0.0)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    import cmath\n\n    def convert(complex_number):\n        polar_coordinates = cmath.polar(complex_number)\n        return polar_coordinates\n    ```\n\n    The `convert` function takes a complex number as input and uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert it to polar coordinates.
