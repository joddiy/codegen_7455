Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_not_prime(2) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def is_not_prime(num):\n        if num <= 1:\n            return True\n        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return True\n        return False\n    ```\n    The `is_not_prime` function takes a number as input and returns `True` if the number is not a prime number, and `False` otherwise.
