Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to convert a given tuple of positive integers into a single integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_to_int((1,2,3))==123\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def tuple_to_int(t):\n        return int(''.join(map(str, t)))\n    ```\n    The `tuple_to_int` function takes a tuple `t` as input and uses the `int` function to convert the tuple elements into a single integer.
