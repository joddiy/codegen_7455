Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]) ==  720000000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def unique_product(lst):\n        unique_numbers = set(lst)\n        product = 1\n        for num in unique_numbers:\n            product *= num\n        return product\n    ```\n    The `unique_product` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the product of the unique numbers in the list.
