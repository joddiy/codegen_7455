Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_Volume(base, height, length):\n        volume = (base * height * length) / 2\n        return volume\n    ```\n\n    The `find_Volume` function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`.
