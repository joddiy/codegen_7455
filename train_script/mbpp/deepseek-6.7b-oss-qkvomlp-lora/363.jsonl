Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose sum is equal to \u2018sum\u2019. The funtion gets as input a list of numbers and the sum,. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_pairs_count([1,1,1,1],2) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def get_pairs_count(nums, target):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n    The `get_pairs_count` function iterates through the list of numbers and for each pair of numbers, it checks if their sum is equal to the target.
