Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to reverse only the vowels of a given string (where y is not a vowel). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_vowels(\"Python\") == \"Python\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def reverse_vowels(s):\n        vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n        s = list(s)\n        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n        while i < j:\n            if s[i] not in vowels:\n                i += 1\n            elif s[j] not in vowels:\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n        return ''.join(s)\n    ```\n    The `reverse_vowels` function takes a string `s` as input and reverses only the vowels of the string.
