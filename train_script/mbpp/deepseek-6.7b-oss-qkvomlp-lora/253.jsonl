Finally, it returns the length of the longest sublist.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(lst):\n    max_length = 0\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n    return max_length\n```\n\nThe `Find_Max_Length` function iterates through the input list of sublists and finds the length of the longest sublist.
