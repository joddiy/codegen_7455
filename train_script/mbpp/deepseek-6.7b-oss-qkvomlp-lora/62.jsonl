Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\",6) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\n        binary_string = binary_string * rotations\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(binary_string)):\n            if int(binary_string[i]) % 2 == 1:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n    The `odd_Equivalent` function takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input.
