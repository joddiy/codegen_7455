Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert bell_number(2)==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def bell_number(n):\n        bell = [1]\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            new_row = [1]\n            for j in range(1, i):\n                new_row.append(new_row[j-1] + bell[j])\n            new_row.append(2*new_row[-1])\n            bell = new_row\n        return bell[-1]\n    ```\n    The `bell_number` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the Bell numbers and returns the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers."}
