Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check(70) == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check(num):\n    # Reverse the number\n    rev_num = 0\n    temp = num\n    while temp > 0:\n        rev_num = rev_num * 10 + temp % 10\n        temp //= 10\n\n    # Check if the number is one less than twice its reverse\n    return num == (rev_num * 2) - 1\n\n# Test the function\nassert check(70) == False\n```"}
