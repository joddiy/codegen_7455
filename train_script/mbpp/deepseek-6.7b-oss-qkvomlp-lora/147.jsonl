The assertion `assert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27` checks if the function correctly returns the nth decagonal number for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth decagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_num_decagonal(n):\n    return n * (3 * n - 2)\n```\nThe `is_num_decagonal` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth decagonal number, which is calculated as `n * (3 * n - 2)`.
