Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth octagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_octagonal(5) == 65\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def is_octagonal(n):\n        return n * (3 * n - 2)\n    ```\n    The `is_octagonal` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth octagonal number, which is calculated as `n * (3 * n - 2)`.
