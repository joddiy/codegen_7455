Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def check_type(tup):\n        data_type = type(tup[0])\n        for item in tup:\n            if type(item) != data_type:\n                return False\n        return True\n    ```\n    The `check_type` function takes a tuple as input and checks if all the elements have the same data type.
