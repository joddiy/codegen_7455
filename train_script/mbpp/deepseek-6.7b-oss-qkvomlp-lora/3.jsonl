It uses the bitwise XOR operation to find the difference between the two numbers and then checks if the result has exactly one bit set to 1. If the result has exactly one bit set to 1, it means that the two numbers differ at one bit position only, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):\n    xor_result = num1 ^ num2\n    return bin(xor_result).count('1') == 1\n```\nThe `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` function takes two numbers as input and returns `True` if they differ at one bit position only, and `False` otherwise.
