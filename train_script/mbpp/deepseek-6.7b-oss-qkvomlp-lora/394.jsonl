Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]])==[10, 11, 12]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_sum_list(lst):\n    max_sum = 0\n    max_list = []\n    for sublist in lst:\n        if sum(sublist) > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum(sublist)\n            max_list = sublist\n    return max_list\n```\nThe `max_sum_list` function iterates through the list of lists and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum.
