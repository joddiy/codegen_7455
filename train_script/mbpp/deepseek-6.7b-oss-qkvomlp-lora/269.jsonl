Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert surface_Area(3,4) == 33\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def surface_Area(base_edge, height):\n        base_area = base_edge ** 2\n        lateral_area = 4 * base_edge * height\n        surface_area = 2 * base_area + lateral_area\n        return surface_area\n    ```\n    The `surface_Area` function takes the base edge and height as input and calculates the surface area of a square pyramid using the formula:\n    ```\n    Surface Area = 2 * Base Area + Lateral Area\n    ```\n    The base area is calculated as the square of the base edge, and the lateral area is calculated as 4 times the base edge multiplied by the height.
