Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    union_set = set(tuple1) | set(tuple2)\n    return tuple(sorted(union_set))\n```\nThe `union_elements` function takes two tuples as input and uses the `set` data structure to find the union of the elements.
