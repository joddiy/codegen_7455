The output should be a tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {\"MSAM\" : 1, \"is\" : 2, \"best\" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tuple_input, dict_input):\n    tuple_input += (dict_input,)\n    return tuple_input\n```\nThe `add_dict_to_tuple` function takes two inputs: a tuple and a dictionary.
