It uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the tuple with the specified delimiter. The `str` function is used to convert each element to a string before joining. The resulting string is then returned as the output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to concatenate each element of tuple by the delimiter. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert concatenate_tuple((\"ID\", \"is\", 4, \"UTS\") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef concatenate_tuple(tup, delimiter='-'):\n    return delimiter.join(str(x) for x in tup)\n```\n\nThe `concatenate_tuple` function takes a tuple `tup` and an optional delimiter `delimiter` as input.
