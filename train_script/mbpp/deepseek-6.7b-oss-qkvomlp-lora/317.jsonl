Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sum the length of the names of a given list of names after removing the names that start with a lowercase letter. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sample_nam(['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith'])==16\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sample_nam(names):\n    return sum(len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper())\n```\n\nThe `sample_nam` function takes a list of names as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the names that start with an uppercase letter.
