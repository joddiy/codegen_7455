Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def square_Sum(n):\n        return sum(i**2 for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2))\n    ```\n    The `square_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers.
