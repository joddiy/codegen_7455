Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to subtract two lists element-wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Lists must have the same length\")\n    result = [list1[i] - list2[i] for i in range(len(list1))]\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `sub_list` function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the element-wise difference of the input lists.
