Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the n'th star number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_star_num(3) == 37\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_star_num(n):\n        return (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    ```\n    The `find_star_num` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n'th star number.
