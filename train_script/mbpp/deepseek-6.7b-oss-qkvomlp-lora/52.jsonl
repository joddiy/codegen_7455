Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef multiply_num(numbers):\n    product = 1\n    for num in numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product / len(numbers)\n\n# Test the function\nassert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThe `multiply_num` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the product of all the numbers divided by the length of the list.
