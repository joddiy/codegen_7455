Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        if len(lst) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(lst)\n            max_list = lst\n    return max_list\n```\n\nThe `Find_Max` function iterates through the list of lists and keeps track of the list with the maximum length.
