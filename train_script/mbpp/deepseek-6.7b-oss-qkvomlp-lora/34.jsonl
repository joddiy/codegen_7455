Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the length of the word is odd or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert word_len(\"Hadoop\") == False\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def word_len(word):\n        return len(word) % 2 != 0\n    ```\n    The `word_len` function takes a word as input and returns `True` if the length of the word is odd, and `False` otherwise.
