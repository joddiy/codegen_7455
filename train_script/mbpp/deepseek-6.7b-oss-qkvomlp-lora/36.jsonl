Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a sphere. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    def volume_sphere(radius):\n        return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n\n    # Test the function\n    assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)\n    ```\n\n    The `volume_sphere` function takes the radius of a sphere as input and returns its volume using the formula for the volume of a sphere.
