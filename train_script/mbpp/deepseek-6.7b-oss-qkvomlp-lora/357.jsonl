Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether a list of numbers contains only one distinct element or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert unique_Element([1,1,1]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def unique_Element(nums):\n        return len(set(nums)) == 1\n    ```\n    The `unique_Element` function takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns `True` if the list contains only one distinct element, and `False` otherwise.
