Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n        return 4 * side_length * side_length\n    ```\n    The `lateralsurface_cube` function takes the side length of a cube as input and returns the lateral surface area of the cube. The lateral surface area of a cube is calculated as 4 times the square of the side length."}
