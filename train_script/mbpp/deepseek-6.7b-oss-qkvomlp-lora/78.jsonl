Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])==2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    freq = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        if item in freq:\n            freq[item] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[item] = 1\n    max_freq = max(freq.values())\n    for item, count in freq.items():\n        if count == max_freq:\n            return item\n```\n\nThe `max_occurrences` function creates a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each item in the input list.
