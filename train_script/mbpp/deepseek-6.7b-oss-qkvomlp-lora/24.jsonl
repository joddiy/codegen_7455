Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of positive numbers in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pos_count([1,-2,3,-4]) == 2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def pos_count(lst):\n        count = 0\n        for num in lst:\n            if num > 0:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    ```\n    The `pos_count` function iterates through the input list and increments the count for each positive number it encounters.
