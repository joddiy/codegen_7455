Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def cummulative_sum(tuple_list):\n        total = 0\n        for tup in tuple_list:\n            total += sum(tup)\n        return total\n    ```\n\n    The `cummulative_sum` function takes a list of tuples as input and calculates the cumulative sum of all the values present in the tuples.
