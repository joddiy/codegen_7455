Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])==[1, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef intersection_array(arr1, arr2):\n    set1 = set(arr1)\n    set2 = set(arr2)\n    return list(set1.intersection(set2))\n```\n\nThe `intersection_array` function takes two arrays as input and returns the intersection of the two arrays as a list.
