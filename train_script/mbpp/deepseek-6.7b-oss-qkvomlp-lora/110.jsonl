Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cylinder. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert math.isclose(lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lateral_surface_cylinder(radius, height):\n    lateral_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * height\n    return lateral_area\n\n# Test the function\nassert math.isclose(lateral_surface_cylinder(10, 5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)\n```\n\nThe `lateral_surface_cylinder` function calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder using the formula `2\u03c0rh`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height of the cylinder.
