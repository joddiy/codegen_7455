Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count number of digits in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef number_ctr(string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe `number_ctr` function iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is a digit using the `isdigit` method.
