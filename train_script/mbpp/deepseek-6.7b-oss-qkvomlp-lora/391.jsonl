Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n        if a == b == c:\n            return 3\n        elif a == b or b == c or a == c:\n            return 2\n        else:\n            return 0\n    ```\n    The `test_three_equal` function takes three integers as input and returns the count of equal numbers.
