Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    perfect_squares = []\n    for num in range(start, end+1):\n        if (num**0.5).is_integer():\n            perfect_squares.append(num)\n    return perfect_squares\n```\n\nThe `perfect_squares` function iterates through the range of numbers from `start` to `end`, checks if each number is a perfect square, and appends it to the `perfect_squares` list if it is.
