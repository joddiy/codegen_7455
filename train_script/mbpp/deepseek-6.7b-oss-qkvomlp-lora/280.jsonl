Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert removezero_ip(\"216.08.094.196\")==('216.8.94.196')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address):\n    octets = ip_address.split('.')\n    cleaned_octets = [str(int(octet)) for octet in octets]\n    return '.'.join(cleaned_octets)\n```\nThe `removezero_ip` function takes an IP address as input and splits it into its individual octets.
