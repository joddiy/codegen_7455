Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find(10,3) == 3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find(a, b):\n        return a // b\n    ```\n    The `find` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, rounded down to the nearest integer.
