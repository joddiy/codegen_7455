It uses a simple mathematical property of factorials to efficiently calculate the last digit.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert last_Digit_Factorial(4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 1\n        last_digit = 1\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10\n        return last_digit\n    ```\n    The `last_Digit_Factorial` function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the last digit in the factorial of `n`.
