Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer, returned as an integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n    while True:\n        n += 1\n        if str(n) == str(n)[::-1]:\n            return n\n```\nThe `next_smallest_palindrome` function takes an integer `n` as input and iterates through consecutive integers until it finds the next smallest palindrome.
