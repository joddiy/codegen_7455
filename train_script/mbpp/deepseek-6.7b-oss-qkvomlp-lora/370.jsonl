Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    unique_elements = set()\n    total_sum = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num not in unique_elements:\n            unique_elements.add(num)\n            total_sum += num\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThe `find_sum` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all non-repeated elements in the list.
