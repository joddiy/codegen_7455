The volume of a cube is calculated by raising the side length to the power of 3, which is equivalent to multiplying the side length by itself three times.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the volume of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert volume_cube(3)==27\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length):\n    return side_length ** 3\n```\nThe `volume_cube` function takes the side length of a cube as input and returns the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by raising the side length to the power of 3, which is equivalent to multiplying the side length by itself three times."}
