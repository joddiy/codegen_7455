Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find whether all the given tuples have equal length or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def get_equal(tuples):\n        lengths = [len(t) for t in tuples]\n        return all(l == lengths[0] for l in lengths)\n    ```\n    The `get_equal` function takes a list of tuples as input and uses a list comprehension to find the length of each tuple.
