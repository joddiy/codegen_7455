Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef tuple_to_dict(tup):\n    return dict(zip(tup[::2], tup[1::2]))\n```\n\nThe `tuple_to_dict` function takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `zip` function to create a dictionary from the adjacent elements of the tuple.
