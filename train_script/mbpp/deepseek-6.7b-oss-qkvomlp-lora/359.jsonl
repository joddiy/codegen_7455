Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-difference-pair/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def find_min_diff(arr, n):\n        arr.sort()\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n            if diff < min_diff:\n                min_diff = diff\n        return min_diff\n    ```\n    The `find_min_diff` function first sorts the input array `arr`.
