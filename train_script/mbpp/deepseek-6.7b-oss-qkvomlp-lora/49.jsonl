Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        for sublist in list_of_lists:\n            min_length = min(min_length, len(sublist))\n        return min_length\n    ```\n\n    The `Find_Min_Length` function iterates through the list of lists and finds the length of the smallest list.
