Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to join a list of multiple integers into a single integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef multiple_to_single(numbers):\n    return int(''.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\n# Test the function\nassert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50]) == 113350\n```\n\nThe `multiple_to_single` function takes a list of integers as input and uses the `join` method to concatenate their string representations.
