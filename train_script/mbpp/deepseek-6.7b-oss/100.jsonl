{"task_id": "Mbpp/171", "completion": "\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    return 5 * side_length\n```\n\nThe function `perimeter_pentagon` takes the length of the side of a regular pentagon as input and returns the perimeter of the pentagon. Since a regular pentagon has 5 sides, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 5. This solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    return 5 * side_length\n```\n\nThe function `perimeter_pentagon` takes the length of the side of a regular pentagon as input and returns the perimeter of the pentagon. Since a regular pentagon has 5 sides, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 5. This solution satisfies the given assertion."}
