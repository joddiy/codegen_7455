Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by three 'b'. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert not text_match_three(\"ac\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_three(text):\n    pattern = r'ab{3}'\n    if re.search(pattern, text):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert not text_match_three(\"ac\")\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `text_match_three` that uses the `re` module to search for a string that has an 'a' followed by three 'b'.
