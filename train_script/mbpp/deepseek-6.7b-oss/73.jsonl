Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_length(\"11000010001\") == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string):\n    max_diff = 0\n    count_zero = 0\n    count_one = 0\n\n    for char in binary_string:\n        if char == '0':\n            count_zero += 1\n        else:\n            count_one += 1\n        diff = count_one - count_zero\n        if diff < 0:\n            count_zero = count_one = 0\n        else:\n            max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)\n\n    return max_diff\n```\n\nThe `find_length` function iterates through the binary string, keeping track of the count of 0s and 1s.
