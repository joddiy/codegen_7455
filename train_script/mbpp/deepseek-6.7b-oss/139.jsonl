Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst):\n    return sum(lst[1::2])\n```\n\nThe `sum_even_and_even_index` function takes a list `lst` as input and uses list slicing to select the elements at even positions (starting from index 1) and then calculates their sum.
