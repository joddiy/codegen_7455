Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count number items that are identical in the same position of three given lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_samepair([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9],[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_samepair` function iterates through the elements of the three input lists and increments the count whenever the elements at the same index are identical.
