The provided assertion verifies that the function returns 0 for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a number in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    return lst.count(num)\n\n# Test the function\nassert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0\n```\n\nThe `frequency` function takes a list `lst` and a number `num` as input.
