It then calculates the sum of their squares using another list comprehension and returns the result. The provided assertion verifies that the function returns the expected value for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    odd_numbers = [2*i + 1 for i in range(n)]\n    return sum(num**2 for num in odd_numbers)\n\n# Test the function\nassert square_Sum(2) == 10\n```\n\nThe `square_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses a list comprehension to generate the first `n` odd natural numbers.
