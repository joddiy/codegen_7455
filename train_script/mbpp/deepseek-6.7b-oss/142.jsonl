Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Tuples must have the same length\")\n\n    result = tuple(x - y for x, y in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\n    return result\n\nassert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)\n```\n\nThe `substract_elements` function takes two tuples as input and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
