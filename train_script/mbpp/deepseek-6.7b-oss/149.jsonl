It achieves this by comparing the length of the input list with the length of a set created from the input list. If the lengths are equal, it means all elements are unique, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check if the elements of a given list are unique or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert all_unique([1,2,3]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef all_unique(lst):\n    return len(lst) == len(set(lst))\n```\n\nThe `all_unique` function takes a list `lst` as input and returns `True` if all elements in the list are unique, and `False` otherwise.
