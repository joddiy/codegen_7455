Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef swap_numbers(num1, num2):\n    return (num2, num1)\n\n# Test the function\nassert swap_numbers(10, 20) == (20, 10)\n```\n\nThe `swap_numbers` function takes in two numbers `num1` and `num2` and returns a tuple with `num2` as the first element and `num1` as the second element.
