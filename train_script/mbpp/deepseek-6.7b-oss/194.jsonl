The key function `len` is used to compare the lengths of the lists. The list with the maximum length is then returned as the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the element of a list having maximum length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    max_length_list = max(list_of_lists, key=len)\n    return max_length_list\n```\n\nThe `Find_Max` function takes a list of lists as input and uses the `max` function with a custom key function to find the list with the maximum length.
