Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to subtract two lists element-wise. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    return [x - y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]\n\n# Test the function\nassert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]\n```\n\nThe `sub_list` function takes two lists as input and uses a list comprehension with `zip` to subtract corresponding elements from the first list by the elements from the second list.
