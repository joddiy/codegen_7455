Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether all dictionaries in a list are empty or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert empty_dit([{},{},{}])==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef empty_dit(list_of_dicts):\n    return all(len(d) == 0 for d in list_of_dicts)\n```\n\nThe `empty_dit` function takes a list of dictionaries as input and uses the `all` function to check if all dictionaries in the list are empty.
