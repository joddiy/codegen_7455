Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuple_list):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(tuple_list)):\n            diff = abs(tuple_list[i][0] - tuple_list[j][0]) + abs(tuple_list[i][1] - tuple_list[j][1])\n            if diff > max_diff:\n                max_diff = diff\n    return max_diff\n\n# Test the function\nassert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7\n```\n\nThe `max_difference` function iterates through the tuple list and calculates the absolute difference between the first elements of each pair and the second elements of each pair.
