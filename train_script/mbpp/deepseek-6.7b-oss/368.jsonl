It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the string. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the substring, the start index, and the end index of the match. If no match is found, it returns None. This solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')==('python', 0, 6)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef occurance_substring(string, substring):\n    index = string.find(substring)\n    if index != -1:\n        return substring, index, index + len(substring)\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nThe `occurance_substring` function takes a string and a substring as input.
