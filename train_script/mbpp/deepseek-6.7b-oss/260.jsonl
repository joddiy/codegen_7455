Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sort_sublists([['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']])==[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(lst):\n    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in lst]\n```\n\nThe `sort_sublists` function takes a list of lists as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist, sorting it using the `sorted` function.
