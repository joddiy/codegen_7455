Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]])==[10, 11, 12]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_sum_list(list_of_lists):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    result = []\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        if sum(lst) > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum(lst)\n            result = lst\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `max_sum_list` function iterates through the list of lists and calculates the sum of each list.
