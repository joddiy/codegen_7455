It initializes `data_type` with the type of the first element in the tuple. Then, it iterates through the elements and checks if each element is an instance of the same data type as the first element. If any element is not of the same type, the function returns `False`. If all elements have the same type, the function returns `True`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_type(tup):\n    data_type = type(tup[0])\n    for element in tup:\n        if not isinstance(element, data_type):\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThe `check_type` function takes a tuple as input and checks if all elements have the same data type.
