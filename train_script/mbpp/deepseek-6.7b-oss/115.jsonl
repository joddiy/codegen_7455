Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return min(m // 2, 2)\n    else:\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        dp[1] = 1\n        dp[2] = min(m // 2, 2)\n        for i in range(3, n + 1):\n            dp[i] = sum(dp[1:i-1])\n            if dp[i] > m:\n                dp[i] = m\n        return dp[n]\n```\n\nThe `get_total_number_of_sequences` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the total number of sequences for a given value of m and n.
