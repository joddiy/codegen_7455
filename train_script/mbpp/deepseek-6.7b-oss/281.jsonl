Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(nums):\n    even_nums = [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]\n    odd_nums = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]\n    return even_nums[0] - odd_nums[0]\n```\n\nThe `diff_even_odd` function first filters the even and odd numbers from the input list using list comprehensions.
