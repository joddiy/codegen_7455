The `zip` function takes two iterables (in this case, `lst` and `lst[1:]`) and returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the input iterables.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to return a list of all pairs of consecutive items in a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert pair_wise([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5])==[(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef pair_wise(lst):\n    return list(zip(lst, lst[1:]))\n```\n\nThe `pair_wise` function takes a list `lst` as input and uses the `zip` function to pair consecutive items in the list.
