Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert len_log([\"python\",\"PHP\",\"bigdata\"]) == 7\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef len_log(words):\n    max_len = 0\n    for word in words:\n        if len(word) > max_len:\n            max_len = len(word)\n    return max_len\n\n# Test the function\nassert len_log([\"python\",\"PHP\",\"bigdata\"]) == 7\n```\n\nThe `len_log` function iterates through the list of words and keeps track of the length of the longest word encountered.
