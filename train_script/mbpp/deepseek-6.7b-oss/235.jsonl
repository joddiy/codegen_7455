Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n\n    max_ending_here = [0] * n\n    min_ending_here = [0] * n\n\n    max_ending_here[0] = arr[0]\n    min_ending_here[0] = arr[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        max_ending_here[i] = max(arr[i], max_ending_here[i-1] * arr[i], min_ending_here[i-1] * arr[i])\n        min_ending_here[i] = min(arr[i], max_ending_here[i-1] * arr[i], min_ending_here[i-1] * arr[i])\n\n    return max(max_ending_here)\n```\n\nThe `max_product` function initializes two arrays, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, to store the maximum and minimum products ending at each index.
