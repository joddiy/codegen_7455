The provided assertion verifies the correctness of the function.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\")==(False)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_two_three(text):\n    pattern = r'a(b{2,3})'\n    if re.search(pattern, text):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nassert text_match_two_three(\"ac\") == False\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `text_match_two_three` that uses the `re` module to search for the pattern 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters in the input string.
