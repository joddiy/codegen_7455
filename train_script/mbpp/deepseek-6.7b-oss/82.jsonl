The formula for calculating the nth hexagonal number is `n * (2 * n - 1)`. The provided assertion verifies that the function returns the correct hexagonal number for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth hexagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert hexagonal_num(10) == 190\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n):\n    return n * (2 * n - 1)\n\nassert hexagonal_num(10) == 190\n```\n\nThe `hexagonal_num` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth hexagonal number.
