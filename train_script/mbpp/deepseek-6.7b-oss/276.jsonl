It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the range of numbers between the square roots of `start` and `end`, inclusive, and returns the squares of these numbers. The assertion verifies that the function produces the expected output for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start, end):\n    return [num**2 for num in range(int(start**0.5), int(end**0.5)+1)]\n\nassert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nThe `perfect_squares` function takes two numbers as input, `start` and `end`, and returns a list of perfect squares between these numbers.
