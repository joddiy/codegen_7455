It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 2 if it's even and reduce `n` by 1 if it's odd. If `n` becomes 0 at the end, it returns True, indicating that the number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2. Otherwise, it returns False.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return True  # 0 can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            n -= 1  # Reduce n by 1\n        else:\n            n //= 2  # Divide n by 2\n    return n == 0  # If n becomes 0, it can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2\n```\n\nThe `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two` function takes an integer `n` as input and iteratively checks whether it can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2.
