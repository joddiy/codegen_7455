It achieves this by first sorting the list and then comparing it with a range of numbers from the minimum value to the maximum value of the list. If the sorted list matches this range, it means the input list contains consecutive numbers, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_Consecutive([1,2,3,4,5]) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst):\n    return sorted(lst) == list(range(min(lst), max(lst) + 1))\n```\n\nThe `check_Consecutive` function takes a list `lst` as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.
