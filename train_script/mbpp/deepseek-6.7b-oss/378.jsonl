It initializes `left` and `right` pointers to the start and end of the list, respectively. It then iteratively updates the `left` and `right` pointers based on the comparison of the middle element with the given value. Finally, it returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert right_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, value):\n    left, right = 0, len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\n\nThe `right_insertion` function takes a sorted list `arr` and a value `value` as input.
