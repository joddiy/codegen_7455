Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)=={'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef dict_filter(dictionary, n):\n    return {key: value for key, value in dictionary.items() if value >= n}\n```\n\nThe `dict_filter` function takes in a dictionary and an integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary based on the values, keeping only the entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The filtered dictionary is then returned.
