It initializes `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array, respectively. It then iteratively calculates the middle index and compares the value at that index with the given value. If the value at the middle index is less than the given value, it updates `left` to be the middle index + 1. Otherwise, it updates `right` to be the middle index. This process continues until `left` and `right` converge, at which point the function returns the value of `left`, which represents the left insertion point for the given value in the sorted array.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/data-structures-and-algorithms/python-data-structure-exercise-24.php. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)==4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, value):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] < value:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n```\n\nThe `left_insertion` function takes a sorted array `arr` and a value `value` as input.
