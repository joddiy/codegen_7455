Finally, the modified string is returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(string, char):\n    # Remove first occurrence of the character\n    string = string.replace(char, '', 1)\n    \n    # Remove last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = string.rfind(char)\n    if last_index != -1:\n        string = string[:last_index] + string[last_index+1:]\n    \n    return string\n```\n\nThe `remove_Occ` function takes a string and a character as input.
