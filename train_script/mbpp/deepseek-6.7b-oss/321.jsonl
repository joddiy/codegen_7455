It returns a new array where the first `k` elements are reversed, and the remaining elements are left unchanged. This is achieved by slicing the input array `arr` into two parts: the first `k` elements and the remaining elements. Then, the first `k` elements are reversed using the `[::-1]` slicing notation, and the two parts are concatenated to form the desired output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to reverse an array upto a given position. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    return arr[:k][::-1] + arr[k:]\n```\n\nThe `reverse_Array_Upto_K` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input.
