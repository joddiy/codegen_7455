The function achieves this by using the bitwise OR operation with the binary number `0b10101010101010101010101010101010`, which has all even bits set to 1. This binary number is then used to set the even bits of the input number `n`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    return n | 0b10101010101010101010101010101010  # Set all even bits of n\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `even_bit_set_number` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the value of `n` with all even bits set.
