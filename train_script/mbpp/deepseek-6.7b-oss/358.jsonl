Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\n    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]\n    return month_number in months_with_30_days\n```\n\nThe `check_monthnumber_number` function takes a month number as input and checks if the month contains 30 days.
