Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(tuples_list):\n    min_product = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(tuples_list)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(tuples_list)):\n            product = tuples_list[i][0] * tuples_list[j][1]\n            if product < min_product:\n                min_product = product\n    return min_product\n\n# Test the function\nassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8\n```\n\nThe `min_product_tuple` function iterates through the list of tuples and calculates the product of each pair of tuples.
