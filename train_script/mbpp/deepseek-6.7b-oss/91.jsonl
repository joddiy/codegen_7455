Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef find_solution(a, b, n):\n    for x in range(n + 1):\n        for y in range(n + 1):\n            if a * x + b * y == n:\n                return x, y\n    return None\n```\n\nThe `find_solution` function iterates through all possible values of x and y within the range of `n` and checks if the given equation `ax + by = n` holds true for any pair of x and y.
