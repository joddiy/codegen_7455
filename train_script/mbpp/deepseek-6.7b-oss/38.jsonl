Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef newman_conway(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"1\"\n    elif n == 2:\n        return \"1 1\"\n    else:\n        sequence = [1, 1]\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            num = sequence[sequence[i-1]-1] + sequence[i-sequence[i-1]]\n            sequence.append(num)\n        return \" \".join(map(str, sequence))\n\ndef sequence(n):\n    return int(newman_conway(n).split()[-1])\n\nassert sequence(10) == 6\n```\n\nThe `newman_conway` function generates the newman conway sequence up to the nth term, and the `sequence` function returns the nth term of the sequence.
