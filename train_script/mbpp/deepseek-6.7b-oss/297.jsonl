Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef merge(list_of_lists):\n    result = [[sublist[i] for sublist in list_of_lists] for i in range(2)]\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\n```\n\nThe `merge` function takes a list of lists as input and uses list comprehension to create a new list where the first element of each sublist is paired with the first element of the original list, the second element of each sublist is paired with the second element of the original list, and so on.
