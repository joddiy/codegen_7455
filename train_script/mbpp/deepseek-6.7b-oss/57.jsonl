Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m). Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef eulerian_num(n, m):\n    if m == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + eulerian_num(n, m - 1)\n\nassert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4\n```\n\nThe `eulerian_num` function recursively calculates the Eulerian number a(n, m) based on the given parameters n and m.
