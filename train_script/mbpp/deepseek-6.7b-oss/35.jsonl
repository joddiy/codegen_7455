{"task_id": "Mbpp/80", "completion": "\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6\n```\n\nThe function `tetrahedral_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth tetrahedral number using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`. This formula is derived from the definition of a tetrahedral number, which is the sum of the first n natural numbers. The assertion `assert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35` ensures that the function correctly calculates the nth tetrahedral number for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth tetrahedral number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert tetrahedral_number(5) == 35\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6\n```\n\nThe function `tetrahedral_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth tetrahedral number using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`.
