Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to perform index wise multiplication of tuple elements in the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):\n    result = tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nassert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))\n```\n\nThe `index_multiplication` function takes two tuples as input and uses the `zip` function to iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
