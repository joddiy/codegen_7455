Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert long_words(3,\"python is a programming language\")==['python','programming','language']\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef long_words(n, words):\n    return [word for word in words.split() if len(word) > n]\n\n# Test the function\nassert long_words(3, \"python is a programming language\") == ['python', 'programming', 'language']\n```\n\nThe `long_words` function takes two parameters: `n` and `words`.
