Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]])==[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sort_matrix(matrix):\n    # Calculate the sum of each row in the matrix\n    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in matrix]\n    \n    # Sort the matrix based on the row sums\n    sorted_matrix = [x for _, x in sorted(zip(row_sums, matrix))]\n    \n    return sorted_matrix\n```\n\nThe `sort_matrix` function first calculates the sum of each row in the input matrix using a list comprehension.
