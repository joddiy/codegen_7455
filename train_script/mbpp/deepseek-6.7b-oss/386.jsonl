Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write function to find the sum of all items in the given dictionary. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef return_sum(dictionary):\n    return sum(dictionary.values())\n```\n\nThe `return_sum` function takes a dictionary as input and uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all its values. This solution satisfies the given assertion as it correctly returns the sum of all items in the dictionary."}
