Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(text):\n    pattern = r'\\b[^z]*z[^z]*\\b'\n    return bool(re.search(pattern, text))\n\n# Test the function\nassert text_match_wordz_middle(\"pythonzabc.\")==True\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `text_match_wordz_middle` that uses the `re` module to search for a word containing 'z' except at the start and end of the word.
