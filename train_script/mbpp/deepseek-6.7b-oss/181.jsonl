Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the median of three numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a, b, c):\n    if (a <= b and b <= c) or (c <= b and b <= a):\n        return b\n    elif (b <= a and a <= c) or (c <= a and a <= b):\n        return a\n    else:\n        return c\n```\n\nThe `median_numbers` function takes three numbers as input and returns the median of the three numbers.
