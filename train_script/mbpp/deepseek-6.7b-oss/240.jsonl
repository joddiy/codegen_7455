It uses the `replace` method of strings to replace all occurrences of the old character with the new character, and returns the modified string. This solution satisfies the given assertion.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to replace characters in a string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert replace_char(\"polygon\",'y','l')==(\"pollgon\")\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef replace_char(input_string, old_char, new_char):\n    return input_string.replace(old_char, new_char)\n```\n\nThe `replace_char` function takes an input string, an old character to be replaced, and a new character.
