It then checks if the index is even and adds the even index binomial coefficient to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of even index binomial coefficients.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) == 8\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum of even index binomial coefficients\n    even_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the range of n\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        # Calculate the binomial coefficient using the formula (n k) = nCk = n!/kNor(n-k)!\n        binomial_coeff = factorial(n) // (factorial(i) * factorial(n-i))\n        \n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Add the even index binomial coefficient to the sum\n            even_sum += binomial_coeff\n    \n    return even_sum\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` function iterates through the range of n and calculates the binomial coefficient for each index.
