Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find minimum k records from tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-find-minimum-k-records-from-tuple-list/ - in this case a verbatim copy of test cases. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef min_k(tuple_list, k):\n    sorted_tuple_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort the tuple list based on the second element\n    return sorted_tuple_list[:k]  # Return the first k elements of the sorted list\n```\n\nThe `min_k` function takes a list of tuples and an integer `k` as input. It sorts the tuple list based on the second element of each tuple and then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted list. This solution satisfies the given assertion."}
