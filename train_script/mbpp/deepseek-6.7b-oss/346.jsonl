Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert capital_words_spaces(\"Python\") == 'Python'\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s):\n    result = ''\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if i > 0 and s[i].isupper():\n            result += ' '\n        result += s[i]\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nassert capital_words_spaces(\"Python\") == 'Python'\n```\n\nThe `capital_words_spaces` function iterates through the characters of the input string `s`.
