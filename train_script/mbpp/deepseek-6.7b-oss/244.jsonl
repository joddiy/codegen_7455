Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_lowercase(\"PYTHon\")==('PYTH')\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_lowercase(s):\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            result += char\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nassert remove_lowercase(\"PYTHon\") == \"PYTH\"\n```\n\nThe `remove_lowercase` function iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
