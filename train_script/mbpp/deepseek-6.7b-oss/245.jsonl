Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the first digit of a given number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert first_Digit(123) == 1\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef first_Digit(num):\n    # Convert the number to a string and return the first character\n    return int(str(num)[0])\n```\n\nThe `first_Digit` function takes a number as input and converts it to a string to extract the first character.
