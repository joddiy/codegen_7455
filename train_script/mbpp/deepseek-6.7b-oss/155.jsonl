The range function is used to generate the even numbers from 2 to 2*n, and the sum function is then used to calculate the sum of their squares. The result is then returned as the output.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert square_Sum(2) == 20\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    return sum(i**2 for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2))\n```\n\nThe `square_Sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers.
