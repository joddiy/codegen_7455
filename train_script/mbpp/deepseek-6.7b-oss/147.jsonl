The provided assertion verifies that the function correctly calculates the nth decagonal number for the given input.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the nth decagonal number. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_num_decagonal(n):\n    return n * (2 * n - 1)\n\n# Test the function\nassert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27\n```\n\nThe `is_num_decagonal` function takes a number `n` as input and returns the nth decagonal number, which is calculated using the formula `n * (2 * n - 1)`.
