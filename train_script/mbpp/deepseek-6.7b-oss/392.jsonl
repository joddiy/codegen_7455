Then, it calculates the square root of the input number using `math.sqrt` and converts it to an integer to get the nearest whole number. Finally, it checks if the square of the nearest whole number is equal to the input number, returning `True` if they are equal, indicating that the input number is a perfect square, and `False` otherwise.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-given-number-is-perfect-square-in-cpp/. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert not is_perfect_square(10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(num):\n    if num < 0:\n        return False  # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares\n\n    sqrt_num = int(math.sqrt(num))\n    return sqrt_num * sqrt_num == num\n```\n\nThe `is_perfect_square` function first checks if the input number is negative, in which case it returns `False` as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares.
