Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the sum of an array. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef _sum(arr):\n    total = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        total += num\n    return total\n\n# Test the function\nassert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6\n```\n\nThe provided solution defines a function `_sum` that iterates through the input array and calculates the sum of its elements.
