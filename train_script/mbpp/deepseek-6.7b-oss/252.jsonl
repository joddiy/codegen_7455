Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    union_set = set(tuple1 + tuple2)  # Find the union of elements using set\n    union_list = list(union_set)  # Convert the union set to a list\n    union_list.sort()  # Sort the list\n    return tuple(union_list)  # Return the sorted list as a tuple\n```\n\nThe `union_elements` function first combines the elements of the input tuples using the `+` operator to create a single list.
