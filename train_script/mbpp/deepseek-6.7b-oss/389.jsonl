It uses bitwise left shift (`<<`) and bitwise right shift (`>>`) operations to perform the rotation and returns the result after masking it to ensure a 32 bit output. The assertion `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` is satisfied by this function.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert left_rotate(16,2) == 64\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef left_rotate(num, d):\n    # In binary, the number 16 is represented as 0001 0000\n    # Left rotation by 2 bits results in 0010 0001, which is 64 in decimal\n    # Perform left rotation using bitwise operations\n    return ((num << d) | (num >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Mask to ensure 32 bit result\n```\n\nThe `left_rotate` function takes two parameters: `num` (the number to be rotated) and `d` (the number of bits to rotate left).
