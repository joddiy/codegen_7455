It handles the edge case of a list with less than 2 elements and returns `None` if the list is empty.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])==-2\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef second_smallest(lst):\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        return None  # Handle edge case for lists with less than 2 elements\n\n    smallest = float('inf')  # Initialize smallest to positive infinity\n    second_smallest = float('inf')  # Initialize second_smallest to positive infinity\n\n    for num in lst:\n        if num < smallest:\n            second_smallest = smallest\n            smallest = num\n        elif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:\n            second_smallest = num\n\n    return second_smallest if second_smallest != float('inf') else None  # Return second_smallest if it's not infinity, otherwise return None\n```\n\nThe `second_smallest` function iterates through the list, updating `smallest` and `second_smallest` as it goes.
