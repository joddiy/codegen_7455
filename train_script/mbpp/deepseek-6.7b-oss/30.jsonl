Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i*i - j*j == n:\n                return True\n    return False\n\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\n```\n\nThe `dif_Square` function iterates through all possible combinations of squares and checks if the difference of two squares equals the given number `n`.
