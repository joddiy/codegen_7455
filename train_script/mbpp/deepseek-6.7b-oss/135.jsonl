{"task_id": "Mbpp/266", "completion": "\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    return 4 * side_length ** 2\n```\n\nThe function `lateralsurface_cube` takes the side length of a cube as input and returns the lateral surface area of the cube. The lateral surface area of a cube is calculated as 4 times the square of the side length. Therefore, the function simply returns the result of 4 times the square of the input side length.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    return 4 * side_length ** 2\n```\n\nThe function `lateralsurface_cube` takes the side length of a cube as input and returns the lateral surface area of the cube.
