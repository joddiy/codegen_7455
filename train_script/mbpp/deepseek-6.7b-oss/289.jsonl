Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    ludic_numbers = []\n    for num in range(1, n+1):\n        if all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1)):\n            ludic_numbers.append(num)\n    return ludic_numbers\n```\n\nThe `get_ludic` function iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is a lucid number.
