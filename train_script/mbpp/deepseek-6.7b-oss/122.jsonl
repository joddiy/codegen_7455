Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef count_X(tup, element):\n    return tup.count(element)\n\n# Test the function\nassert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0\n```\n\nThe `count_X` function takes a tuple `tup` and an element `element` as input.
