Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        result.append((max(tuple1[i][0], tuple2[i][0]), max(tuple1[i][1], tuple2[i][1])))\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThe `maximize_elements` function takes two tuples as input and iterates through each pair of elements, selecting the maximum value from each pair.
