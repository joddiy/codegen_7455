Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i . Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    max_sum = 0\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        if arr[j] > arr[i] and j > k:\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, arr[j])\n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThe `max_sum_increasing_subseq` function iterates through the array starting from the element at index `i+1` and finds the maximum sum of increasing subsequence that includes the element at index `k`.
