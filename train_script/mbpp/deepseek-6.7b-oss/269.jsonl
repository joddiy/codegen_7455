Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert surface_Area(3,4) == 33\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge, height):\n    # Calculate the surface area of a square pyramid\n    base_area = base_edge ** 2\n    lateral_area = 4 * (base_edge * height)\n    surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    return surface_area\n\n# Test the function\nassert surface_Area(3, 4) == 33\n```\n\nThe `surface_Area` function takes the base edge and height as input and calculates the surface area of a square pyramid using the formula for the surface area of a square pyramid.
