Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a function to remove tuples from the given tuple. Your code should satisfy the following assertion:\n```python\nassert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef remove_nested(tup):\n    return tuple(x for x in tup if not isinstance(x, tuple))\n```\n\nThe `remove_nested` function iterates through the given tuple and filters out any elements that are themselves tuples.
