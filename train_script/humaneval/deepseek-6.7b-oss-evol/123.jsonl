Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    def collatz(n):\n        result = [n]\n        while n != 1:\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                n = n // 2\n            else:\n                n = 3 * n + 1\n            result.append(n)\n        return result\n\n    collatz_sequence = collatz(n)\n    odd_numbers = [num for num in collatz_sequence if num % 2 != 0]\n    return sorted(list(set(odd_numbers)))\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input.
