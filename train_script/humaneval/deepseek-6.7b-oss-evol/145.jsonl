The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element from the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting purposes. In this case, the key function is a lambda function that returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the number, and the second element is the index of the number in the original list.\n\nThe `abs` function is used to handle negative numbers, as the sum of their digits should be the same as the sum of their positive counterparts. The `str` function is used to convert the number to a string so that we can iterate over its digits. The `int` function is used to convert each digit back to an integer.\n\nThe `sorted` function sorts the list in ascending order first by the sum of the digits, and then by the index in the original list if the sums are equal. The `lambda` function is a concise way to define a small anonymous function.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(x))), nums.index(x)))\n```\n\nThis Python script uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list of integers.
