The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element from the array and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the function `lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x)` is used. This function returns a tuple where the first element is the number of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element is the number itself. The `sorted` function sorts the array first by the first element of the tuple (the number of ones in the binary representation), and then by the second element of the tuple (the number itself).\n\nThe `bin` function is used to convert the number to its binary representation as a string. The `count` method is used to count the number of '1' characters in the string.\n\nThe `lambda` keyword is used to define a small anonymous function. In this case, it's a function that takes a number and returns a tuple.\n\nThe `print` function is used to output the result of the `sort_array` function.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
