It uses a generator expression to iterate over each number in the list, rounding each number to the nearest integer using the `round` function. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the rounding is done correctly for negative numbers. The `** 2` operator is used to square the number. The `sum` function then adds up all the squared numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    return sum(int(abs(num) + 0.5) ** 2 for num in lst)\n```\n\nThe function `sum_squares` takes a list of numbers as an argument.
