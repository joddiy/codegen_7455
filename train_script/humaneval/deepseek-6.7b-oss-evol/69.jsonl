Return the greatest integer that is greater than \n    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. \n    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.\n    If no such a value exist, return -1.\n    Examples:\n        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2\n        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3\n        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1\n    '''\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef search(lst):\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(lst)\n    for num in sorted(count.keys(), reverse=True):\n        if num <= count[num]:\n            return num\n    return -1\n\nprint(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2\nprint(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3\nprint(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis script uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the frequency of each integer in the list.
