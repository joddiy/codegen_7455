Since the smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is 8, if the given number is less than 8, it cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Therefore, the function returns False. If the given number is 8 or greater, the function returns True.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
