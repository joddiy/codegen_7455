Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    new_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        new_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        new_words.append(new_word)\n    return ' '.join(new_words)\n```\n\nThe function `anti_shuffle` splits the input string into words, sorts each word's characters in ascending order, and then joins them back together with spaces in between.
