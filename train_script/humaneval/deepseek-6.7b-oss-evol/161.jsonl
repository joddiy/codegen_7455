It first checks if the string contains any letters using the `any` function and the `isalpha` method. If it doesn't, it reverses the string and returns it. If it does, it iterates over each character in the string, and if the character is a lowercase letter, it converts it to uppercase, and if it's an uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase.
