If the array is empty, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it initializes two variables: `sign_product` to 1 and `sum_magnitudes` to 0. It then iterates over each number in the array, updating `sign_product` to be the product of its current value and -1 if the number is negative, and 1 if the number is positive. It also updates `sum_magnitudes` to be the sum of its current value and the absolute value of the number. Finally, it returns the product of `sign_product` and `sum_magnitudes`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
