The function calculates the total number of carrots that can be eaten by adding `number` and the minimum of `need` and `remaining`. It then calculates the number of carrots left after the meals by subtracting `need` from `remaining` and taking the maximum of the result and 0.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    \"\"\"\n    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,\n    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n    \n    Example:\n    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]\n    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]\n    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]\n    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n    \n    Variables:\n    @number : integer\n        the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n    @need : integer\n        the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n    @remaining : integer\n        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n    \n    Constrain:\n    * 0 <= number <= 1000\n    * 0 <= need <= 1000\n    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\n    Have fun :)\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    # Calculate the total number of carrots that can be eaten\n    total_eaten = number + min(need, remaining)\n    # Calculate the number of carrots left after the meals\n    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)\n    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `eat` that takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`.
