This is done by incrementing `i` until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`, at which point `i` is a prime factor of `n`. The function then divides `n` by `i` and continues this process until `n` is no longer divisible by any number. The final value of `n` is the largest prime factor of the original `n`.\n\nThe `print` statements at the end are used to test the function with the given examples.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
