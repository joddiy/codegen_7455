It iterates over the list in reverse order, starting from the second last element. For each element, it checks if it is greater than or equal to the previous element. If it is, it returns the index of the previous element. If no such element is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef can_arrange(arr):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which\n    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If\n    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain\n    duplicate values.\n\n    Examples:\n    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3\n    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef can_arrange(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr)-1, 0, -1):\n        if arr[i] >= arr[i-1]:\n            return i-1\n    return -1\n```\n\nThis Python script defines a function `can_arrange(arr)` that takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
