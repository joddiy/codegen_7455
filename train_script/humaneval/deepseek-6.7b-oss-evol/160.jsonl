The first list has basic algebra operations, and \n    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric \n    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.\n\n    The basic algebra operations:\n    Addition ( + ) \n    Subtraction ( - ) \n    Multiplication ( * ) \n    Floor division ( // ) \n    Exponentiation ( ** ) \n\n    Example:\n    operator['+', '*', '-']\n    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n    => result = 9\n\n    Note:\n        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.\n        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.\n        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.\n\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operator, operand):\n    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n        return \"Invalid input\"\n\n    expression = str(operand[0])\n    for i in range(len(operator)):\n        expression += \" \" + operator[i] + \" \" + str(operand[i+1])\n\n    return eval(expression)\n\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\noperand = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(do_algebra(operator, operand))  # Output: 9\n```\n\nThis Python script first checks if the length of the operator list is equal to the length of the operand list minus one.
