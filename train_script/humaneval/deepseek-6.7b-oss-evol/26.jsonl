For each number, it checks if it has been seen before. If it hasn't, it adds it to the `seen` set and appends it to the `result` list. This way, the `result` list only contains unique numbers from the input list, while maintaining the order of the numbers.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
