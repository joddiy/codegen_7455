Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    # Split the string into sentences\n    sentences = S.split('.') + S.split('!') + S.split('?')\n    # Initialize the count of boredoms\n    boredom_count = 0\n    # Iterate over the sentences\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        # If the sentence starts with \"I\", increment the count\n        if sentence.strip().startswith(\"I\"):\n            boredom_count += 1\n    # Return the count of boredoms\n    return boredom_count\n```\n\nThis script works by first splitting the input string into sentences based on the punctuation marks.
