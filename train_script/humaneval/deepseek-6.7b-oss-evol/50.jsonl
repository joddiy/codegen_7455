This is done by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of the character and then taking the modulo 26 of the result. This ensures that the character wraps around to the end of the alphabet if it goes beyond 'z'. Finally, the ASCII value of 'a' is added to bring the character back to its original position in the alphabet.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
