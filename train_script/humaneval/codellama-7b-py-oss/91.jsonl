A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of boredoms in the given string.\n    \"\"\"\n    boredoms = 0\n    sentences = S.split('.
