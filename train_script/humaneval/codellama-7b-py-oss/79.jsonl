It uses the `bin` function to convert the decimal number to binary and then adds 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the binary string to ensure the correct format. The `zfill` method is used to ensure that the binary string is padded with '0' to ensure it has a length of 8 characters.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
