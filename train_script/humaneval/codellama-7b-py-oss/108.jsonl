Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef count_nums(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns\n    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n    >>> count_nums([]) == 0\n    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1\n    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef count_nums(arr):\n    count = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num))) > 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe `count_nums` function iterates through the input array and checks each element.
