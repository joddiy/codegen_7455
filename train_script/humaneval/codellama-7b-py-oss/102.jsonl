It first checks if either `x` or `y` is not even, in which case it returns -1. Otherwise, it iterates through the range from `max(x, y)` to `min(x, y)` in steps of -2, checking for the biggest even number within the given range. If such a number exists, it is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
