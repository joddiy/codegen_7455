It initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0. Then, it iterates through the list using a for loop and checks the index of each entry. If the index is a multiple of 3, it squares the entry and adds it to the `total_sum`. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, it cubes the entry and adds it to the `total_sum`. Finally, the function returns the `total_sum` as the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"\"\n    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a \n    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not \n    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \n    \n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6\n    For lst = []  the output should be 0\n    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            total_sum += lst[i] ** 2\n        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:\n            total_sum += lst[i] ** 3\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `sum_squares` that takes a list `lst` as input.
