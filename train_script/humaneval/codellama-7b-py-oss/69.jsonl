Return the greatest integer that is greater than \n    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. \n    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.\n    If no such a value exist, return -1.\n    Examples:\n        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2\n        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3\n        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1\n    '''\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef search(lst):\n    freq = {}\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in freq:\n            freq[num] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[num] = 1\n\n    max_num = -1\n    for num in freq:\n        if num > 0 and freq[num] >= num:\n            max_num = max(max_num, num)\n\n    return max_num\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `search` that takes a list of positive integers as input.
