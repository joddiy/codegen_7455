Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is\n    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.\n    \n    For example:\n    words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\n    words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits the string into words and returns an array of the words.\n\n    Args:\n    s: A string of words separated by commas or spaces.\n\n    Returns:\n    A list of words from the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the string into words using either commas or spaces as delimiters\n    words = s.split(', ')\n    if ',' in s and ' ' in s:\n        words = s.split(', ')\n    elif ',' in s:\n        words = s.split(',')\n    elif ' ' in s:\n        words = s.split()\n    return words\n```\n\nThe `words_string` function takes a string `s` as input and splits it into words using either commas or spaces as delimiters.
