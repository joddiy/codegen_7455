{"task_id": "HumanEval/121", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solution(lst):\n    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 != 0)\n```\n\nThis script works by using a generator expression to select every second element (i.e., the elements at even positions) from the list. It then uses the `sum` function to add up all of the odd elements in these selected elements.\n\nThe `if lst[i] % 2 != 0` part of the generator expression ensures that only odd elements are included in the sum.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(solution([5, 8, 7, 1]))  # Output: 12\nprint(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # Output: 9\nprint(solution([30, 13, 24, 321]))  # Output: 0\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
