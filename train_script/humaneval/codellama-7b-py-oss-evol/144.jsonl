The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False\n    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,\n    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.\n\n    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\n\n    simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") = True\n    simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\") = False\n    simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\") = False\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef simplify(x, n):\n    x_num, x_den = map(int, x.split('/'))\n    n_num, n_den = map(int, n.split('/'))\n\n    # Multiply the numerators and denominators\n    product_num = x_num * n_num\n    product_den = x_den * n_den\n\n    # Check if the product is a whole number\n    return product_num % product_den == 0\n\nprint(simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\"))  # True\nprint(simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\"))  # False\nprint(simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\"))  # False\n```\n\nThis solution works by first splitting the input strings into numerator and denominator parts, converting them to integers, and then multiplying the numerators and denominators.
