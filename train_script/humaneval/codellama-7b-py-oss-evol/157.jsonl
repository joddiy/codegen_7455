Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    # Sort the sides to ensure c is the longest side\n    sides = sorted([a, b, c])\n    # Check if the longest side is equal to the sum of the other two sides\n    return sides[-1] == sides[0] + sides[1]\n\nprint(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)) # True\nprint(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)) # False\n```\n\nThis script works by first sorting the input sides into ascending order.
