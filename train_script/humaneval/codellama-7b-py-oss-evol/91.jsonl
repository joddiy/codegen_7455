Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    sentences = S.split('.
