If it is, it returns None. Otherwise, it creates two lists: one with the signs of the numbers (1 for positive numbers, -1 for negative numbers, and 1 for zero) and one with the magnitudes of the numbers. It then returns the sum of the products of the corresponding elements from the two lists.\n\nFor example, if the input is [1, 2, 2, -4], the signs list would be [1, 1, 1, -1] and the magnitudes list would be [1, 2, 2, 4].
