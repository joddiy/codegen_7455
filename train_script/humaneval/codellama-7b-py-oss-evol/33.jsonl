{"task_id": "HumanEval/33", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sort_third(l: list):\n    third_elements = sorted([i for i in l[::3]])\n    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):\n        l[i] = third_elements.pop(0)\n    return l\n```\n\nThis script first creates a list of the third elements of the original list, sorts it, and then replaces the third elements of the original list with the sorted elements. The `pop(0)` function is used to remove and return the first element from the sorted list, which is then inserted into the original list at the third position. This process is repeated until all third elements have been replaced.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\nprint(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
