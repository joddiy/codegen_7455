When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, it returns False. If not, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After going through all the brackets, if the stack is empty, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
