{"task_id": "HumanEval/37", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sort_even(l: list):\n    even_indices = [i for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]\n    even_values = sorted([l[i] for i in even_indices])\n    for i, val in zip(even_indices, even_values):\n        l[i] = val\n    return l\n```\n\nThis script works by first creating a list of the even indices in the input list. It then creates a sorted list of the values at these even indices. Finally, it replaces the values at the even indices in the input list with the sorted values.\n\nThe `zip` function is used to iterate over both lists simultaneously, ensuring that the sorted values are correctly inserted into the correct positions in the original list.\n\nThe function can be tested with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\nprint(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Output: [3, 6, 5, 4]\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
