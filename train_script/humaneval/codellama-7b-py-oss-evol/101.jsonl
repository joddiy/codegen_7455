Your task is\n    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.\n    \n    For example:\n    words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\n    words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    # Replace commas with spaces\n    s = s.replace(\",\", \" \")\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    return words\n```\n\nThis script first replaces all commas in the string with spaces, then splits the string into words using the split() function.
