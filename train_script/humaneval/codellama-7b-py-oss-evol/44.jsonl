{"task_id": "HumanEval/44", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Change numerical base of input number x to base.\n    return string representation after the conversion.\n    base numbers are less than 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    convert_string = \"0123456789\"\n    result = \"\"\n    while x > 0:\n        remainder = x % base\n        result = convert_string[remainder] + result\n        x = x // base\n    return result\n```\n\nThis script works by repeatedly dividing the input number by the target base and taking the remainder. This remainder is then used to index into a string of the digits 0-9, which are concatenated to the beginning of the result string. The input number is then divided by the base and the process is repeated until the input number is 0.\n\nThe function can be tested with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'\nprint(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'\nprint(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
