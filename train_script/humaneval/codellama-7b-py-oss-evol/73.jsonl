A palindromic array is an array that\n    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.\n\n    For example:\n    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Create a frequency dictionary\n    freq = {}\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] in freq:\n            freq[arr[i]] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[arr[i]] = 1\n\n    # Count the frequency of elements in the first half of the array\n    first_half = n // 2\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(first_half):\n        if arr[i] != arr[n - i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n\n    # If the array is already palindromic, return 0\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Count the frequency of elements in the second half of the array\n    second_half = n - first_half\n    for i in range(first_half, first_half + second_half):\n        if arr[i] != arr[n - i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n\n    # If the array is already palindromic, return 0\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Count the frequency of elements in the first half of the array\n    for i in range(first_half):\n        if arr[i] != arr[n - i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n\n    # If the array is already palindromic, return 0\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Count the frequency of elements in the second half of the array\n    for i in range(first_half, first_half + second_half):\n        if arr[i] != arr[n - i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nThis script works by first creating a frequency dictionary of the elements in the array.
