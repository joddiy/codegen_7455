{"task_id": "HumanEval/8", "completion": "\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    sum_num = 0\n    product_num = 1\n    for num in numbers:\n        sum_num += num\n        product_num *= num\n    return (sum_num, product_num)\n```\n\nThis script works by initializing two variables, `sum_num` and `product_num`, to 0 and 1 respectively. It then iterates over each number in the input list, adding the number to `sum_num` and multiplying `product_num` by the number. After the loop, it returns a tuple containing `sum_num` and `product_num`.\n\nThe function is tested with the examples provided in the problem statement:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)\nprint(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)\n```", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
