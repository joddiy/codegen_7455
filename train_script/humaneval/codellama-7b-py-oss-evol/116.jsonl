{"task_id": "HumanEval/116", "completion": "\n Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n```\n\nThis solution uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts an iterable based on a key function. The key function for this problem is a lambda function that takes an element from the array and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the count of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element is the number itself.\n\nThe `bin` function is used to convert the number to binary. The `count` method is then used to count the number of ones in the binary representation. The `sorted` function then sorts the array based on these tuples.
