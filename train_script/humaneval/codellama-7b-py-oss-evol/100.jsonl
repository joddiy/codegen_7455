For each iteration, it calculates the number of stones in the current level by adding the initial number of stones (n) and the current number (i). If n is even, it adds 2i to the initial number of stones, which results in an odd number of stones. If n is odd, it adds 2i + 1 to the initial number of stones, which results in an even number of stones. The calculated number of stones is then appended to the result list.
