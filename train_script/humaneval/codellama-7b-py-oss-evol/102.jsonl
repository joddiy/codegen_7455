Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the\n    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If \n    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n    For example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    # Initialize the maximum even number to -1\n    max_even = -1\n\n    # Iterate over the range from x to y\n    for num in range(x, y + 1):\n        # Check if the number is even and greater than the current max_even\n        if num % 2 == 0 and num > max_even:\n            # Update the max_even if a greater even number is found\n            max_even = num\n\n    # Return the max_even\n    return max_even\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(choose_num(12, 15))  # Output: 14\nprint(choose_num(13, 12))  # Output: -1\n```"}
