If\n    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain\n    duplicate values.\n\n    Examples:\n    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3\n    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n Here is a Python script that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef can_arrange(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):\n        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\nprint(can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]))  # Output: 3\nprint(can_arrange([1,2,3]))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis script works by iterating over the array in reverse order.
