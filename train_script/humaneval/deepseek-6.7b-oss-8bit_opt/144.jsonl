Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef simplify(x, n):\n    \"\"\"Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression\n    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False\n    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,\n    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.\n\n    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\n\n    simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") = True\n    simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\") = False\n    simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\") = False\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef simplify(x, n):\n    x_num, x_den = map(int, x.split('/'))\n    n_num, n_den = map(int, n.split('/'))\n    return x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num\n```\nThe `simplify` function takes two fractional strings `x` and `n` as input.
