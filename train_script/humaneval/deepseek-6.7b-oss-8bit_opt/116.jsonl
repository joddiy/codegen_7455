Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to\n    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.\n    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n\n    It must be implemented like this:\n    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    # Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the original value and the count of ones in its binary representation\n    binary_counts = [(num, bin(num).count('1')) for num in arr]\n\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the count of ones in their binary representation and then by the decimal value\n    sorted_arr = sorted(binary_counts, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Extract the original values from the sorted list of tuples and return the sorted array\n    return [num for num, _ in sorted_arr]\n```"}
