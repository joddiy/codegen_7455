Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef will_it_fly(q,w):\n    '''\n    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n\n    Example:\n    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) \u279e False \n    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) \u279e False\n    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) \u279e True\n    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3], 5) \u279e True\n    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n    '''\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef will_it_fly(q, w):\n    if sum(q) <= w and q == q[::-1]:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```"}
