For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string\n    '())' is not.\n    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'\n    '''\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    left_count = lst[0].count('(')\n    right_count = lst[1].count(')')\n    if left_count + right_count == 0:\n        return 'Yes'\n    elif left_count + right_count == 1:\n        return 'No'\n    else:\n        return 'Yes'\n```\nThe solution checks the count of open and close parentheses in the two strings.
