A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of boredoms in the given string of words.\n\n    Args:\n    S: str - The input string of words.\n\n    Returns:\n    int - The count of boredoms in the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    sentences = S.split('.') + S.split('?') + S.split('\u00a1')  # Split the string into sentences\n    count = 0\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        if sentence.strip().startswith('I'):  # Check if the sentence starts with 'I'\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```"}
