Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the\n    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If \n    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n    For example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        for i in range(y, x-1, -1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                return i\n        return -1\n```\nThe `choose_num` function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`, in which case it returns -1.
