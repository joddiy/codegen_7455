Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    \"\"\"Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement \n    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly \n    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.\n    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.\n    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.\n    Examples:\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) ==> [\"little\"]\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 3) ==> [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"]\n    select_words(\"simple white space\", 2) ==> []\n    select_words(\"Hello world\", 4) ==> [\"world\"]\n    select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3) ==> [\"Uncle\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    vowels = set(\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n    words = s.split()\n    selected_words = [word for word in words if sum(1 for char in word if char not in vowels) == n]\n    return selected_words\n```"}
