The `decode_shift` function takes an encoded string `s` as input and returns the decoded string. The encoding and decoding is done by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of each character in the string and then taking the modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet.\n\n    ### Test Cases:\n    ```python\n    assert encode_shift(\"hello\") == \"mjqqt\"\n    assert decode_shift(\"mjqqt\") == \"hello\"\n    assert encode_shift(\"\") == \"\"\n    assert decode_shift(\"\") == \"\"\n    ```\n\n    ### Edge Cases:\n    - The function handles empty strings correctly.\n    - The function handles strings with non-alphabetic characters correctly.\n    - The function handles strings with uppercase characters correctly.\n\n    ### Time Complexity:\n    Both functions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because they iterate through each character in the string.\n\n    ### Space Complexity:\n    Both functions have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because they create a new string of the same length as the input string.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
