It uses the `join` method of the string class to concatenate the numbers into a single string, separated by spaces. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, and the `str` function is used to convert each number to a string before joining them.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
