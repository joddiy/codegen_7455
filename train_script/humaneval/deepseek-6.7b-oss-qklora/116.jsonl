Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to\n    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.\n    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n\n    It must be implemented like this:\n    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n    ```python\n    def sort_array(arr):\n        # Convert each number to binary and count the number of ones\n        binary_counts = [(bin(num).count('1'), num) for num in arr]\n        \n        # Sort the array based on the count of ones and decimal value\n        sorted_arr = [num for _, num in sorted(binary_counts)]\n        \n        return sorted_arr\n    ```\n    \n    This solution first converts each number to its binary representation using the `bin` function.
