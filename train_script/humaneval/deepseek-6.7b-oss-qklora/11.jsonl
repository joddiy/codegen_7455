It then iterates through the two strings simultaneously, performs binary XOR on the corresponding characters, and returns the result as a string. The `int(x) ^ int(y)` expression converts the characters to integers and performs the XOR operation, and then the `str` function converts the result back to a string. Finally, the `join` method is used to concatenate the results into a single string.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
