It does this by first creating a set of the elements in `l`, which removes duplicates, and then converting the set back to a list using the `list` constructor. Finally, the sorted list is returned.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef unique(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return sorted unique elements in a list\n    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef unique(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return sorted unique elements in a list\n    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(set(l))\n```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The `unique` function takes a list `l` as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in `l`.
