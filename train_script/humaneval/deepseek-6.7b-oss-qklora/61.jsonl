It iterates through the brackets string, incrementing the count for each opening bracket and decrementing the count for each closing bracket. If the count ever becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, so the function returns False. Finally, the function returns True if the count is 0, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
