If it is possible to exchange elements between the `lst1` and `lst2` to make all the elements of `lst1` to be even, the function returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\". The function uses list comprehensions to filter out even and odd numbers from the input lists, and then checks if the number of even numbers in `lst1` is equal to the length of `lst1` or if there are no odd numbers in `lst2`.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
