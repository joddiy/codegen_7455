It returns a sorted list of unique common elements between `l1` and `l2`. The `set` function is used to convert the lists to sets, and the `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets. The `sorted` function is used to sort the resulting list.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
