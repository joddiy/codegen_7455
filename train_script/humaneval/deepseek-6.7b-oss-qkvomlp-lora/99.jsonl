It first converts the input value to a float and then uses the `round` function to round the number to the nearest integer. If the number is positive, it adds 0.5 to round up; if the number is negative, it subtracts 0.5 to round down. Finally, it converts the rounded number back to an integer and returns the result.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef closest_integer(value):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant\n    from two integers, round it away from zero.\n\n    Examples\n    >>> closest_integer(\"10\")\n    10\n    >>> closest_integer(\"15.3\")\n    15\n\n    Note:\n    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant\n    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the\n    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer(\"14.5\") should\n    return 15 and closest_integer(\"-14.5\") should return -15.\n    '''\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef closest_integer(value):\n    num = float(value)\n    if num > 0:\n        return int(num + 0.5)\n    else:\n        return int(num - 0.5)\n```\nThe `closest_integer` function takes a value (string) representing a number and returns the closest integer to it.
