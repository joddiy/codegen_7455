Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef prod_signs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef prod_signs(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return None\n    prod = 1\n    sum_magnitudes = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < 0:\n            prod *= -1\n        elif num > 0:\n            prod *= 1\n        sum_magnitudes += abs(num)\n    return prod * sum_magnitudes\n```\nThe solution first checks if the input array is empty and returns None if it is.
