Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and\n    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.\n    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])\n    False\n    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    balance = 0\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\nThe solution iterates through the list of operations, updating the balance accordingly.
