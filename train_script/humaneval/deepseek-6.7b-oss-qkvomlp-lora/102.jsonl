If \n    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n    For example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        x, y = y, x\n    for i in range(y, x-1, -1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            return i\n    return -1\n```\nThe `choose_num` function first checks if `x` is greater than `y` and swaps them if necessary.
