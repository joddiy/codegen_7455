If `n` is 1, it returns 2, as there are 1 and 10. Otherwise, it returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The count is calculated as the sum of the count of numbers that start with 1 and the count of numbers that end with 1.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
