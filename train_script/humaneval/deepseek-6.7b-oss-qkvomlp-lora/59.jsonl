It uses a while loop to iterate through the factors of `n`, starting with 2. If the current factor `i` is a factor of `n`, it divides `n` by `i` and continues the loop. If `i` is not a factor of `n`, it increments `i` by 1. Once the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n`, which is the largest prime factor of the input number.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
