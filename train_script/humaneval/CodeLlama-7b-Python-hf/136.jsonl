If it is, it returns None.\n    If the list is not empty, it creates two variables, largest_neg and smallest_pos.\n    It then iterates through the list and checks if the integer is negative or positive.\n    If it is negative, it checks if largest_neg is None. If it is, it sets largest_neg to the integer.\n    If it is not, it checks if the integer is greater than largest_neg. If it is, it sets largest_neg to the integer.\n    If it is positive, it checks if smallest_pos is None. If it is, it sets smallest_pos to the integer.\n    If it is not, it checks if the integer is less than smallest_pos. If it is, it sets smallest_pos to the integer.\n    It then returns the tuple of largest_neg and smallest_pos.\n\n    ### Additional Comments:\n    This solution is not very efficient.
