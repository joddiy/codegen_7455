Then it creates a for loop that iterates through the list lst. \n    The for loop uses the range function to determine the length of the list. The for loop then uses the modulo operator to determine if the index \n    of the list is a multiple of 3 or 4. If the index is a multiple of 3, the function will square the value of the list at that index. If the index \n    is a multiple of 4, the function will cube the value of the list at that index. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, the function will add \n    the value of the list at that index to the total. The function then returns the total.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"\"\n    This function will take a list of integers.
