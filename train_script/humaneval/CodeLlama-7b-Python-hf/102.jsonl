If \n        there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n        For example:\n        choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n        choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n        \"\"\"\n        if x % 2 != 0:\n            x += 1\n        if y % 2 != 0:\n            y -= 1\n        for i in range(x, y + 1, 2):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                return i\n        return -1\n    ```\n\n    ### Explanation:\n    The function first checks if the first argument is an even number. If it is not, it adds one to it. Then it checks if the second argument is an even number. If it is not, it subtracts one from it. Then it iterates through the range of the two numbers and checks if the number is even. If it is, it returns it. Otherwise, it returns -1.\n\n    ### Example:\n    ```python\n    >>> choose_num(12, 15)\n    14\n    >>> choose_num(13, 12)\n    -1\n    ```\n\n    ### Additional Examples:\n    ```python\n    >>> choose_num(12, 14)\n    12\n    >>> choose_num(12, 13)\n    12\n    >>> choose_num(12, 12)\n    12\n    >>> choose_num(13, 13)\n    -1\n    >>> choose_num(14, 14)\n    -1\n    >>> choose_num(15, 15)\n    -1\n    ```\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the\n    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive.
