The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    The function get_odd_collatz first checks if n is less than 1. If it is, it returns an empty list.\n\n    Then, it creates an empty list called odd_list.\n\n    It then enters the while loop. The while loop continues to execute as long as n is not equal to 1.\n\n    If n is odd, it appends n to odd_list and sets n to 3 * n + 1.\n\n    If n is even, it sets n to n // 2.\n\n    Finally, it appends 1 to odd_list and returns odd_list.\n\n    ### Example:\n    ```python\n    >>> get_odd_collatz(5)\n    [1, 5]\n    >>> get_odd_collatz(10)\n    [1,", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
