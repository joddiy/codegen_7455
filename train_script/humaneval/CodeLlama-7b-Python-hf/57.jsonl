If so, it returns True.\n    If the first element is greater than the second, it checks if all the elements are greater than the next element.\n    If the first element is less than the second, it checks if all the elements are less than the next element.\n    If the list has only one element, it returns True.\n\n    ### Additional Comments:\n    The function is not very efficient.
