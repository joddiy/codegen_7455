Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef reverse_delete(s,c):\n    \"\"\"Task\n    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n    then check if the result string is palindrome.\n    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.\n    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.\n    Example\n    For s = \"abcde\", c = \"ae\", the result should be ('bcd',False)\n    For s = \"abcdef\", c = \"b\"  the result should be ('acdef',False)\n    For s = \"abcdedcba\", c = \"ab\", the result should be ('cdedc',True)\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef reverse_delete(s,c):\n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c)\n    return (result, result == result[::-1])\n```"}
