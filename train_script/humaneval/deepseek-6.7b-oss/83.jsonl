If `n` is 1, the function returns 2, as there are two numbers that start or end with 1 in a 1-digit number: 1 and 10. Otherwise, it returns the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, which is calculated as 10 raised to the power of (n-1) plus 10.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
