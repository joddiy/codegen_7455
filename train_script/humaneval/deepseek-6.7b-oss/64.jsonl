It initializes a variable `vowels` to store the vowels 'aeiou'. It then iterates through each character in the input string, checking if the character is a vowel (case-insensitive).

Here, 'y' is also a\n    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> vowels_count(\"abcde\")\n    2\n    >>> vowels_count(\"ACEDY\")\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef vowels_count(s):\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.lower() in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `vowels_count` that takes a string `s` as input.
