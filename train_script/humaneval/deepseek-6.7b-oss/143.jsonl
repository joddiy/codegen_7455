Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    return ' '.join(prime_words)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"This is a test\"))  # Output: \"is\"\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"lets go for swimming\"))  # Output: \"go for\"\n```"}
