Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    odd_numbers = []\n    while n != 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n // 2\n        else:\n            odd_numbers.append(n)\n            n = 3 * n + 1\n    odd_numbers.append(1)\n    return sorted(odd_numbers)\n```\n\nThe `get_odd_collatz` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and iterates through the Collatz sequence, appending the odd numbers to a list.
