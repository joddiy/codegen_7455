It first checks if the array is empty and returns `None` in that case. Then, it calculates the sum of magnitudes of the integers in the array using a generator expression. Next, it initializes the product of signs to 1 and iterates through the array to update the product based on the signs of the numbers. Finally, it returns the product of magnitudes and signs.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef prod_signs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef prod_signs(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return None\n    sum_magnitudes = sum(abs(num) for num in arr)\n    product_signs = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        if num > 0:\n            product_signs *= 1\n        elif num < 0:\n            product_signs *= -1\n        else:\n            product_signs *= 0\n    return sum_magnitudes * product_signs\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `prod_signs` that takes an array `arr` as input.
