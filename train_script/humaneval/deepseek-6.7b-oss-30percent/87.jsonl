Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n\n    ### Instruction:\n    Create a Python script for this problem:\n    Write a solution to the following problem:\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,\n    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n    each row may contain a different number of columns.\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,\n    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.\n    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.\n    \n    Examples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n    get_row([], 1) == []\n    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n    ### Response:\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    coordinates = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(len(lst[i])):\n            if lst[i][j] == x:\n                coordinates.append((i, j))\n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n    return coordinates\n```"}
