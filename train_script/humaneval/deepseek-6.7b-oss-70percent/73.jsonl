It initializes `changes` to 0 and sets `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the array minus 1. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right`. Inside the loop, it checks if the elements at `left` and `right` are not equal. If they are not equal, it increments `changes` by 1. Finally, it returns the total number of changes required to make the array palindromic.", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
